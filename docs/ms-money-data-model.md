# Microsoft Money Data Model

Reference for the `.mny` file format. A `.mny` file is a Jet 4 database in a
Money-specific variant ("MSISAM"), so the tables below are ordinary Access
tables once the file is decrypted.

None of this is official documentation. It is reverse-engineered, and the parts
that were never observed say so.

> **Provenance.** The original of this document is
> `poc/import-from-dotmny:migration/ms-money-data-model.md` -- a path in that
> branch's tree, not in this one -- from PR #192 by
> **marksimpson**, derived from analysis of a real 30-year Money file. That

## Dates

`mdb-reader` decodes Jet datetimes natively, from an absolute epoch. Dates
arrive as JavaScript `Date` objects and need no parsing.

> **Correction.** The original describes dates as `MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS` strings
> with a null sentinel of day `00` and a 70-year pivot for the two-digit year.
> That is what `mdb-export` prints, not what the file holds -- the pivot logic
> is an artefact of the CSV round-trip, and reproducing it would misdate every
> pre-1970 transaction.
>
> The real "no date" sentinel is **year 10000** (`+010000-02-28`). It is common:
> 1,320 of the 2,292 date values in `money2002.mny` are it. Jet's own zero date
> (1899-12-30) also appears. Monize normalises anything outside 1900–2199 to
> null (`model/mny-values.ts`, `toDate`).

## Key tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `DHD` | File defaults -- one row, holds the base currency |
| `ACCT` | Accounts (bank, investment, loan, etc.) |
| `PAY` | Payees |
| `CAT` | Categories (hierarchical) |
| `CRNC` | Currencies |
| `CRNC_EXCHG` | Exchange rate history |
| `SEC` | Securities (stocks, funds, and currency pseudo-securities) |
| `SEC_SPLIT` | Stock splits |
| `SP` | Security price history |
| `TRN` | All transactions, cash and investment alike |
| `TRN_INV` | Investment detail for a `TRN` row (quantity, price, commission) |
| `TRN_SPLIT` | Split transaction children |
| `TRN_XFER` | Transfer pairs |
| `LOT` | Tax lots -- Money's authoritative record of share ownership |
| `BILL` | Scheduled transaction instances |

Not every table exists in every Money version. `BILL` is absent from Money 2001
entirely, which is what crash-looped the proof of concept. Monize reads every
table through `getTableOrNull` and every column through a spec with a declared
default, so an absent table yields zero rows and an absent column yields the
default -- both reported rather than thrown (`tables/table-reader.ts`).

```

Not every investment-related `TRN` row has a `TRN_INV` row. Cash dividends and
interest (`act` 3 and 4) and cash corporate actions (`act` 14) exist only in
`TRN`. **Drive an investment importer from `TRN`, never from `TRN_INV`** --
iterating `TRN_INV` drops every dividend, which is exactly what the proof of
concept did.

### `TRN.hpay` is `TRN.lHpay` in Money Plus

A file has exactly one of the two columns. Reading only `hpay` drops every payee
on a Money 2001 or 2002 file; reading only `lHpay` drops them on a Money Plus
file. Monize's reader takes a list of column aliases, newest first.

## DHD (file defaults)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hcrncDef` | FK to `CRNC` -- **the file's base currency** |
| `hcrncCur` | Display currency. Null in every file examined |
| `lcid` | Windows locale id |

> **Addition.** The original has no `DHD` section. The base currency has to come
> from here: hardcoding a fallback is what left the proof of concept importing a
> British file as NZD.

## PAY (payees)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hpay` | Primary key |
| `szFull` | Payee name |
| `fHidden` | Hidden flag |

Money keeps degenerate rows -- `#`, `*`, names that are empty once trimmed --
which are internal placeholders and never real payees.

## CAT (categories)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hcat` | Primary key |
| `szFull` | Category name |
| `hcatParent` | FK to parent category (null for the two roots) |
| `nLevel` | Depth (0 = root) |
| `lType` | Income/expense classification -- see below |
| `fTax` | Tax-related flag |

Sort by `nLevel` ascending when inserting, so parents exist before children.

Every tree descends from one of two roots: `INCOME` (`hcat` 130) and `EXPENSE`
(`hcat` 131), the only rows with `nLevel` 0 and a null `hcatParent`.

> **Addition.** `lType` is missing from the original, and it is the clean signal
> for income versus expense: `{2, 3}` income, `{0, 1}` expense, `-1` for the two
> roots themselves. Cross-tabbed against root ancestry over 349 categories in
> three Money vintages, there is no crossover. Root-ancestor classification is
> the fallback for the roots, not the primary signal.

## CRNC (currencies)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hcrnc` | Primary key |
| `szIsoCode` | ISO 4217 code (`GBP`, `USD`, ...) |
| `szName` | Currency name |
| `szSymbol` | Quote symbol, always shaped `/GBPUS` |
| `fHidden` | Hidden flag. **Absent before Money Plus** |

## CRNC_EXCHG (exchange rates)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hcrncFrom` | FK to `CRNC` -- source currency |
| `hcrncTo` | FK to `CRNC` -- target currency |
| `dt` | Rate date |
| `rate` | Exchange rate |
| `fHist` | Historical flag |

## ACCT (accounts)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hacct` | Primary key |
| `szFull` | Account name |
| `at` | Account type (below) |
| `hcrnc` | FK to `CRNC` |
| `amtOpen` | Opening balance |
| `amtLimit` | Credit limit |
| `dtOpen` / `dtClose` | Opened / closed dates |
| `fClosed` | Closed flag |
| `fFavorite` | Favourite flag |
| `fWatch` | Watch-account flag ("Investments to Watch") -- imported as excluded from net worth |
| `hacctRel` | Linked account, meaningful for `at = 5` |
| `mComment` | Free-text comment |

### Account types (`at`)

| at | Meaning | Monize type |
|----|---------|-------------|
| 0 | Bank (chequing/savings) | CHEQUING |
| 1 | Credit card | CREDIT_CARD |
| 2 | Cash | CASH |
| 3 | Asset | ASSET |
| 4 | Loan | LOAN |
| 5 | Investment | INVESTMENT (paired) |
| 6 | Mortgage | MORTGAGE |

Only `at` 0 and 5 appear in the committed fixtures; the rest are carried from
the original and are marked unconfirmed in `model/mny-model.ts`. An `at` value
outside this table is skipped with a counted warning, never guessed at.

### Investment account pairs

An investment account (`at = 5`) points at its cash sleeve through `hacctRel`.
This maps exactly onto Monize's linked INVESTMENT_CASH + INVESTMENT_BROKERAGE
pair. Not every investment account has one.

> **Correction.** A `z ` prefix on an account name is *not* a Money closure
> signal -- it is one user's personal naming convention, and treating it as one
> closes accounts that are open. Only `fClosed` marks an account closed.

## TRN (all transactions)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `htrn` | Primary key |
| `hacct` | Account FK |
| `hacctLink` | Linked account, for some transfers |
| `hsec` | Security FK -- **its presence is what makes a row an investment row** |
| `dt` | Transaction date |
| `amt` | Cash amount, signed (negative = cash leaving the account) |
| `act` | Action type (below) |
| `hcat` | Category FK |
| `lHpay` / `hpay` | Payee FK |
| `mMemo` | Memo |
| `szId` | Reference, behind a one-digit kind marker (below) |
| `cs` | Cleared status: 0 unreconciled, 1 cleared, 2 reconciled |
| `frq` | `-1` for a real posting; anything else is a scheduler artefact |
| `grftt` | Bit flags (below) |
| `hbillHead` | Bill series this row was posted for. **Absent in Money 2001** |

An investment row is identified by carrying a security, not by its action code:
`act = 0` is BUY and is indistinguishable from a plain payment by `act` alone.

> **Correction.** The original gives `szId` as the reference number outright. It
> is the reference behind a leading digit naming its kind, and importing the
> string whole puts `1Debit` and `0           2` in the register.

Neither reading of `szId` was ever checkable against the corpus -- no committed
fixture carries a single non-null value of it. Both the packed shapes and the
debt-account rule came from files that cannot be committed, and a claim about
what Money *displays* cannot be measured from the file at all. Where the code
has to assume something about Money's UI, say so in the comment and expect a
user to be the one who settles it.

### The `act` field

The original's table is reproduced in the **Correction** below; this one is what
the files measure, read off `LOT` (which transaction opened and closed each tax
lot) and `TRN_XFER` (whether Money records a cash counterpart at all).

| act | Meaning | `TRN_INV` row? | Cash counterpart? | Monize action |
|-----|---------|:--------------:|:-----------------:|---------------|
| 0 | Buy, Money 2001-era | yes | — | BUY |
| 1 | Buy | yes | 2,015 of 2,029 | BUY |
| 2 | Sell | yes | 165 of 180 | SELL |
| 3 | Cash dividend | **no** | 1,090 of 1,090 | DIVIDEND, amount from `TRN.amt` |
| 4 | Interest paid to cash | **no** | — | INTEREST, amount from `TRN.amt` |
| 5 | Reinvest (variant) | yes | — | REINVEST + warning |
| 9 | Reinvested distribution | yes | **0 of 1,020** | REINVEST |
| 10 | Reinvest Interest | ? | — | REINVEST_INTEREST + warning |
| 12 | Add Shares: units credited to a plan account | yes | **0 of 92** | REINVEST + warning |
| 13 | Remove shares / close lots | yes | — | REMOVE_SHARES |
| 14 | Cash corporate action | **no** | — | CAPITAL_GAIN + warning |
| 15 | Add shares / open lots | yes | — | ADD_SHARES, or TRANSFER_IN when paired |
| 16 | Remove shares / close lots | yes | — | REMOVE_SHARES, or TRANSFER_OUT when paired |
| 24 | S-Term Cap Gains Dist, paid to cash | ? | — | CAPITAL_GAIN_SHORT + warning |
| 26 | L-Term Cap Gains Dist, paid to cash | ? | — | CAPITAL_GAIN_LONG + warning |
| 27 | Reinvest S-Term CG Dist | ? | — | REINVEST_CAPITAL_GAIN_SHORT + warning |
| 29 | Reinvest L-Term CG Dist | ? | — | REINVEST_CAPITAL_GAIN_LONG + warning |
| 30 | Redeem CD/Bond | ? | — | REDEEM + warning; proceeds from `TRN.amt` less `TRN_INV.amtInt`, which becomes a linked INTEREST row |
| 32 / 33 | Share transfer in / out | yes | — | TRANSFER_IN / TRANSFER_OUT |
| -1 | Regular non-investment transaction | no | — | — |

`act` 5 and 14 have never been observed in any available file; 12 has been
observed, and issue #1149 supplies Money's own name for it ("Add Shares") --
Monize keeps mapping it to REINVEST so the stated value survives as cost basis.
The `act` 10 / 24 / 26 / 27 / 29 / 30 family was named by issue #1149's reporter
against Money's own register (the labels match Money's QIF vocabulary --
`ReinvInt`, `CGShort`, `CGLong`, `ReinvSh`, `ReinvLg`), but no file measured
here carries one, so their `TRN_INV` shape is marked `?` above. All of these are
listed in `MNY_UNCONFIRMED_ACTIONS`, so every transaction mapped through them
carries a warning rather than a silent mapping. `act` 4 is the code that
graduated: its cash-only shape was measured on both Money Plus files, issue
#1149 named it (Money's "Interest" activity, `IntInc` in QIF), and it now maps
to INTEREST -- it imported as DIVIDEND while the name was unknown, which
misfiled it for tax purposes. `act` 17, 18 and 20 occur in real files but open
and close no lot and have no name, so nothing says what they do to a position:
they stay unmapped and their rows are skipped and counted.

Money's register displays these cash distributions positive while `TRN.amt`
stores them with the file-side sign convention (the one that stores a BUY
positive), so the raw amounts on flagged preview rows can read negative. The
mapper discards the sign and takes direction from the action.

> **Correction.** The original gives `0` Buy, `1` Sell, `3` Reinvest and `5`
> Reinvest (variant). `LOT` disagrees at the first two: `act` 1 opens 3,520 lots
> in a real Money Plus file and closes none, and `act` 2 is the sale. Read that

> and holdings replayed negative. `act` 3 has no `TRN_INV` row, which is a
> dividend rather than a reinvestment; `act` 9 is the reinvestment.

#### `act` 12 credits units that no cash pays for

It opens lots and carries a value and a quantity, so it looks exactly like a
buy -- and mapping it as one overdrew a cash sleeve by $18,457.22 against
Money's own $91.00. What separates it is the cash counterpart: `act` 1 pairs
with a cash row through `TRN_XFER` 2,015 times in 2,029 and `act` 3 does 1,090
times in 1,090, while `act` 12 does so **zero** times in 92 -- exactly like the
`act` 9 reinvestments. 82 of those 92 rows sit in one RRSP whose `ACCT` row has
`fEmpMatch` set, which is what the units appear to be: an employer's side of a
plan contribution, credited without passing through the member's cash.

REINVEST is the Monize action that matches: a value and a position, no cash leg,
cost basis preserved.

Issue #1149 supplied Money's own name for the code: it is the "Add Shares"
activity, which Money also uses for zero-quantity account true-ups and
sub-account transfers that leave the parent account unchanged (those rows
carry a price and a memo but move nothing, and import as valueless REINVEST
rows). The REINVEST mapping is kept deliberately -- Monize's ADD_SHARES
records shares with no cost, so mapping to it would discard the stated value
that Money's Add Shares preserves as basis.

#### `act` 16 closes lots; it is not a sale

The name suggests shares arriving. The `LOT` table proves the opposite: `act` 16
appears as `htrnSell`. A share transfer between accounts is recorded as `act` 16
on the source (closing lots) and `act` 15 on the destination (opening them with
cost basis). Mapping 16 to SELL closes lots against a fabricated price and
corrupts average cost, which is one of the four causes of the "investment
accounts are a mess" report on PR #192.

The two sides carry no link column. They pair implicitly on date, security and
quantity; an unpaired row stays ADD_SHARES or REMOVE_SHARES, which is correct
and common -- shares transferred in from a broker is simply how a portfolio
starts, and `money2002.mny` alone has 60 such rows.

#### Quantity is always positive

`TRN_INV.qty` is stored positive whatever the action. Direction comes only from
`act`. `TRN.amt` is signed but is no better a signal: a dividend reinvestment
(`act` 3 or 5) also has a negative `amt`, being cash spent on shares, and would
read as a sale.

> **Refinement.** Magnitude comes from `TRN.amt`, not from `qty * price +
> commission`. Money's own cash figure already includes commission and accrued
> interest, so recomputing it disagrees with what Money displays by exactly
> those amounts. Take the magnitude from `amt` and the sign from the action.

### The `grftt` bit field

Measured against a real Money Plus file (53,079 `TRN` rows over 56 accounts) by
cross-tabbing each bit against facts the file already settles: which account a
row sits in, whether it appears in `TRN_SPLIT` or `TRN_XFER`, whether it carries
`hsec`, what its memo says.

| Mask | Meaning | What fixes it |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `0x2`, `0x4` | Transfer side | 100% of rows carrying either appear in `TRN_XFER` |
| `0x10` | Investment row | 100% carry `hsec` |
| `0x20` | Split parent | 100% appear as `TRN_SPLIT.htrnParent` |
| `0x40` | Split child | 100% appear as `TRN_SPLIT.htrn` |
| `0x80` | Row is in a loan or mortgage account | 1,239 rows, every one of them in a debt account, and every row in those accounts has it |
| `0x100` | Voided | 31 rows, all `cs = 2`, half zero-amount, memos naming a cancelled or never-presented cheque |
| `0x4000` | Loan-payment template | 50 rows, exactly the ten account-less `ps = 5` split parents plus their legs and those legs' `TRN_XFER` counterparts -- set equality both ways, one family per debt account |
| `0x20000`, `0x40000` | A scheduled instance Money never posted | 67 rows, none reconciled where the file is 74% reconciled, all inside one eleven-month window, all also carrying `0x200000`; excluding them lands four accounts on Money's own balances, and the register does not show them |
| `0x200000` | Member of a scheduled series | 4,653 of 4,692 are `frq != -1` templates, and no template lacks it |

`0x8000` and `0x80000` do not occur in the file at all.

### Loan-payment templates

Money stores the *next* scheduled payment for each loan or mortgage as a
transaction family the register never shows: a split parent with **no `hacct`
at all**, its principal and interest legs, and each transfer leg's counterpart
sitting in the loan account with a real account and a real date. Its amount
mirrors the loan's current payment, so it reads exactly like a genuine posting.

`BILL.lHtrn` does **not** reference these, so the bill-template filter misses
them. Only the parent is self-evidently unusable (no account); the counterparts
are not, and importing them adds principal that no payment funded -- $9,902.63
across seven of the maintainer's debt accounts. `grftt & 0x4000` is what
identifies the whole family, and it is the only reliable handle on it.

> **Correction.** The original reference had `0x80` as "voided" and `0x8000` as

### Phantom transactions

`TRN` holds rows that are not postings and must not be imported:

1. **Scheduler artefacts** (`frq != -1`).
2. **Bill template transactions**, referenced by `BILL.lHtrn`. Templates, not
   postings.
3. **Split children**, referenced by `TRN_SPLIT.htrn`. Their amounts belong to
   the parent; importing them standalone double-counts.
4. **Dangling transfer sides** -- a `TRN_XFER` reference to a `htrn` that is not
   in the file at all.

> **Correction, and the most costly one.** The original also excludes
> scheduler-posted rows (which it read as `grftt & 0x8000`) and voided rows

> which is why loans imported with zero transactions in the proof of concept.

>
> **A counterpart in an account the user chose not to import is not orphaned
> either.** It keeps its row as a plain transaction with a warning: dropping it
> would silently remove real money from an account that *was* imported.

## TRN_INV (investment detail)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `htrn` | FK to `TRN`, and the primary key |
| `dPrice` | Price per unit |
| `qty` | Quantity, always positive |
| `amtCmn` | Commission |
| `amtInt` | Accrued interest. On `act` 30 it is taken out of the gross `TRN.amt`; Money Plus can also store a Redeem CD/Bond activity as `act` 2 with `TRN.amt` already equal to proceeds. Both become a REDEEM with a linked INTEREST transaction (`docs/specs/redemption-accrued-interest.md`). |

## TRN_SPLIT (split children)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `htrn` | FK to `TRN` -- the child row |
| `htrnParent` | FK to `TRN` -- the parent |
| `iSplit` | Position within the split |

Amount, category and memo live on the child's own `TRN` row, not here.

**A split child that also appears in `TRN_XFER` is a transfer leg, not a
category leg.** This is how Money records a loan payment: the principal is a
transfer into the loan account, the interest is an ordinary category leg.
Importing the child as category-only loses the transfer, which is the second
half of the loans-import bug. In Monize it becomes a
`transaction_splits.kind = 'transfer'` row wired to the counterpart, and the
counterpart is imported exactly once.

## TRN_XFER (transfer pairs)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `htrnFrom` | FK to `TRN` -- the from side |
| `htrnLink` | FK to `TRN` -- the to side |

Both sides exist as separate `TRN` rows with their own amounts. Because the
pairing is exact, a `.mny` importer must never fall back to matching transfers
by name and amount the way a QIF importer has to.

### The cash counterpart of a trade, and which side Monize keeps

A `TRN_XFER` pairing whose far side carries `hsec` is never an ordinary
transfer: the investment row is *both* the cash arriving and the trade. Where
the near side sits decides which of Monize's three shapes it becomes.

| Near side | What Money is recording | What Monize does | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| A top-level row in the brokerage's own cash companion (`ACCT.hacctRel`) | The cash half of the trade | **Drops** the row. `writeInvestments` creates that sleeve transaction from the investment row's `cashAmount` and links the two through `investment_transactions.transaction_id` | #1175 |
| A top-level row in any other account | The cash the trade was paid for with, in the account that paid | **Keeps** the row and makes it the trade's cash leg. The trade records the account as its `funding_account_id`, which is what a natively entered trade funded from elsewhere already stores | #1212 |
| A `TRN_SPLIT` child | One leg of a larger transaction -- a paycheque with a purchase in it | **Embeds** the trade in that leg: `transaction_splits.kind = 'investment'` with `investment_transactions.transaction_split_id` pointing back, exactly as a hand-entered investment split (issue #515) is written. The leg's amount is the cash impact, so no cash transaction is written at all | #1211 |

All three defects had the same shape, and it is the one no balance check can
see: **the same movement of money recorded twice, summing to zero.** Importing
the first kind put three rows in the cash register where Money shows one -- the
purchase, plus a transfer in and a transfer out that cancelled. The other two
put a transfer into the brokerage's cash sleeve and had the trade take it
straight back out again, so the sleeve netted to nothing while holding two rows
Money has none of, and the purchase showed in the split editor as a transfer to
an account the user never chose.

`classifyTradeCashSides` (`backend/src/import/mny/map/map-transactions.ts`)
decides all three in one pass, from one predicate, so they cannot disagree; it
qualifies a pairing only when the far side is a trade the import actually
writes, since a security-carrying row the investment mapper skipped has no cash
leg for the near row to be.

## LOT (tax lots)

Money's authoritative record of share ownership.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hlot` | Primary key |
| `hacct` | Account FK |
| `hsec` | Security FK |
| `qty` | Remaining open quantity |
| `htrnBuy` | FK to `TRN` -- the transaction that opened the lot |
| `htrnSell` | FK to `TRN` -- the transaction that closed it, empty while open |
| `dtBuy` / `dtSell` | Buy and sell dates |

Open positions are the sum of `qty` over lots with an empty `htrnSell`. This is
the most reliable statement of what Money considers held: it sidesteps replaying
transactions and handles transfers, splits and corporate actions for free.

**Not every held security has a lot.** Money keeps no `LOT` row for a CD, a U.S.
savings bond or a money-market fund -- it records their trades in `TRN_INV` but
tracks no tax lots for them. Their open-lot reading is therefore `0` even while
the position is open, so the verification cross-check falls back to the
transaction replay (still Money's own data) for any security the file records no
lot for at all. Treating the absent lot as zero shares flagged every such
position as a discrepancy the correct import never introduced.

Monize does **not** import holdings from `LOT`. Holdings come only from the
canonical rebuild over imported transactions -- a second, private fold is what
left the proof of concept with negative positions. `LOT` is used instead as an
independent check: open lots against the action replay, and both against what
Monize ended up holding, with any disagreement reported as a verification
warning rather than a failed import.

## SEC (securities)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hsec` | Primary key |
| `szSymbol` | Ticker symbol, often empty |
| `szFull` | Full name |
| `sct` | Security type |
| `hcrnc` | Currency FK |
| `fHidden` | Hidden flag |

Symbols follow a few conventions: plain for domestic equities, exchange-prefixed
for foreign ones (`GB:VOD`, `US:VT`), and empty for many funds.

> **Correction.** The original gives `sct` a fixed meaning (`1` stock, `2` bond,
> `3` mutual fund, `4` currency). **The codes shift between releases.** The same
> Amex index securities are `sct` 6 in Money 2001 and 2002 and `sct` 7 in Money
> Plus, and `sct` 3 is a unit trust in one of them. Any fixed mapping mislabels
> some file, so Monize deliberately leaves `securityType` null for the user to
> set.
>
> **`sct = 4` is a money-market fund, not a currency.** Money Plus's own
> `sample.mny` files Vanguard, Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney and Woodgrove money
> market funds under it; a real Money Plus file's four `sct = 4` rows are TD
> Canadian Money Market, CIBC Canadian Money Market, CIBC Canadian T-Bill and
> McLean Budden Money Market. Excluding the code as a currency dropped 829 of
> that file's 4,524 investment transactions and left five brokerage cash sleeves
> thousands of dollars out, because the money-market fund *is* the sweep account
> the cash moves through.
>
> Currencies are not in `SEC` at all in any file measured -- they live in `CRNC`,
> whose `szSymbol` always has the shape `/GBPUS`. That symbol shape is the entire
> test Monize applies to a `SEC` row (`isCurrencyPseudoSecurity`); no `sct` code
> is read for meaning anywhere.

## SEC_SPLIT (stock splits)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hss` | Primary key |
| `cshrPre` | Shares before the split |
| `cshrPost` | Shares after the split |
| `dtRecord` | Record date |
| `dPriceSplit` | Price at the split |

> **Addition, with a trap.** The original omits this table.
>
> **`SEC_SPLIT` carries no security handle.** The link runs the other way:
> `SP.hss` points at `SEC_SPLIT.hss`, and the `SP` row's `hsec` is the security.
> Looking for an `hsec` column here finds nothing, because there is not one.
>
> **Money does not apply these rows to share counts, and neither should you.**
> The obvious reading -- ignoring a split leaves every later position wrong by
> its ratio -- is wrong for this table, and two files say so at seven positions
> with no counter-example. A brokerage holding 200 shares bought before a 1:2
> `SEC_SPLIT` and 100 after transfers away in a single 300-share row, and `LOT`
> shows both purchases fully consumed; applying the ratio leaves 200 shares in an
> account Money shows as empty. `sample.mny` agrees: `LOT` holds 3 MSFT against 6
> replayed with its 1:2 split, and 110.25 ADM against 115.7625.
>
> What the rows are is visible in the price history: the `SP` row a split points
> at carries `dPrice = 0` and `src = 0` -- a marker, not a quote -- and the prices
> either side of it are continuous and in the same units as the transactions.
> They are quote-feed metadata, which is why they appear for securities the user
> never held, and why Canadian ETFs record one every December with `cshrPre`
> equal to `cshrPost`.

## SP (security prices)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hsp` | Primary key, monotonic |
| `hsec` | FK to `SEC` |
| `dt` | Price date |
| `dPrice` | Price per unit |
| `hss` | FK to `SEC_SPLIT` when this row records a split |

Duplicate `(hsec, dt)` pairs are normal -- an intraday quote and a close, or a
re-fetch. Deduplicate keeping the highest `hsp`, which is the most recently
written row.

This is the largest table in a real file: 68,000 rows in the 30-year Money Plus
file the importer was built against.

## BILL (scheduled transactions)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hbill` | Primary key |
| `hbillHead` | Series this row belongs to |
| `iinst` | Instance number within the series |
| `lHtrn` | FK to `TRN` -- the template transaction |
| `frq` | Frequency code (below) |
| `cFrqInst` | Interval multiplier |
| `dt` | Due date |
| `dtMax` | Series end date |
| `cInstMax` | Maximum instances |
| `st` | Status |

**`BILL` is an accumulation of instances, not a list of bills.** One row per
occurrence, so a long history holds thousands: 1,844 rows for roughly 20 real
bills in the file the importer was built against. Group by `hbillHead` and
reduce each series to one representative before doing anything else.

> **Correction.** The original records `st = 1` as "active". No file available
> to this project has ever contained a `BILL` row, so no value of `st` has been
> observed and the claim cannot be checked. Monize therefore **filters on
> nothing**: series are selected by date horizon and shape, the raw `st` rides
> along on every candidate, and `npm run mny:inspect` prints its distribution so
> one run against a real file settles it. A plausible-looking constant here
> would be a guess wearing a filter's clothes.

### Frequency codes (`frq`)

| frq | Meaning | Evidence |
|-----|---------|----------|
| 0 | Once | Format reference only |
| 1 | Daily | Format reference only |
| 2 | Weekly | Format reference only |
| 3 | Monthly | Issue #1150: the same file's monthly bills imported monthly |
| 5 | Yearly | Issue #1150: yearly bills imported as `EXACT[5]`, then "every 2 months" |
| 4, 6, 7 | **Unknown** | Claimed yearly / quarterly / semiannual by the original reference, which 5 refutes |

The code alone is not the whole answer: `cFrqInst` multiplies it, and several
combinations land exactly on a distinct recurrence (weekly x 2 is fortnightly,
weekly x 4 is every four weeks, monthly x 3 is quarterly, monthly x 6 is
semiannual). Where no exact equivalent exists, fall to the next **shorter**
period, which is the safer error: an extra reminder is noise, a missed one is a
missed payment.

> **Correction.** The proof of concept mapped bimonthly (every two months) to
> fortnightly and semiannual to yearly -- errors in both directions at once.

> **Correction.** The original recorded 4 as yearly, 5 as every two months, 6 as

**A series' own instance dates outrank its code.** `BILL` holds one row per
occurrence, so the spacing between a series' `dt` values *is* its recurrence --
measured on the file in hand, where `frq` is a table nobody has been able to
check. `map/bill-cadence.ts` reads it (a strict majority of the recent gaps
matching one cadence within 12%), and `map-bills.ts` prefers that answer to
`frq`, falling back to the code only for a series too short to measure. Issue
#1150 is the cost of the other order: every affected file stated "365 days
apart" in data nothing was reading.

## Limitations of this reference

- Written against a small corpus. The five committed sample files
  (`backend/src/import/mny/__fixtures__/`) are portfolio-only: no banking
  transactions, no `BILL` rows, and only `act` 0, 1 and 15. Everything outside
  that is either from the original analysis of one large real file, or unverified.
- Explicitly unresolved: the active values of `BILL.st`, and the real-world
  meaning of `act` 5 and `act` 14. Each needs one run of `npm run mny:inspect`
  against a large real file.
- Money's tables carry far more than the importer reads. Budgets (`BGT*`),
  savings goals, classifications and attachments are all out of scope, and are
  not described here.
