## What RLS does here

Monize enforces multi-tenancy in application code: every service filters by `userId` derived from the JWT. RLS adds a **second wall inside PostgreSQL** so that, even if a query forgets its `WHERE user_id` clause, the database returns only the current user's rows. It is defense in depth, not a replacement for the app-level filtering.

The mechanism: every database operation runs inside a transaction (opened by the `withScopedDb()` helper) whose first statements set **transaction-local** variables (`app.current_user_id` = the effective user, `app.real_user_id` = the authenticated identity -- they differ only when a delegate acts for an owner; via `set_config(..., true)` = `SET LOCAL` semantics); table policies compare each row's owner against them. Postgres reverts the variables at COMMIT/ROLLBACK, so they can never leak onto a pooled connection. A nested `withScopedDb` call joins the ambient transaction (the active EntityManager is carried in its own AsyncLocalStorage scope) rather than opening a second connection. Privileged work (migrations, admin, cron jobs, seeders, pre-identity auth) runs either as the owner role (which bypasses RLS) or with an explicit transaction-local `app.bypass_rls = 'on'` marker.

## Roles and connections

| Role | Privilege | Used by | Subject to RLS? |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Owner (`POSTGRES_USER` -- name is operator-chosen; `monize_user` in `.env.example`, `monize_test` in CI) | Schema owner. Superuser on the compose Postgres image; **non-superuser without `CREATEROLE`** on the CNPG/k8s deployment | `db-init`, `db-migrate`, seed scripts | No (owner bypass -- from table ownership, not superuser-ness; holds in both environments because db-init/db-migrate created every table and `FORCE` is never used) |
| `monize_app` | LOGIN, non-superuser, non-owner, no `BYPASSRLS`, table DML grants only | The long-running API process (`main`) | **Yes** |

The split is **by process**: startup scripts connect as the owner; the API runtime connects as `monize_app`. This is what makes RLS effective — the runtime role cannot bypass policies. No SQL anywhere hardcodes the owner-role name (grants use `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` without `FOR ROLE`, which binds to the current role).

### Pooler compatibility

The GUC is transaction-local and the transaction is the unit every pooler preserves, so the design is **safe under transaction-mode poolers** (e.g. pgBouncer in `transaction` mode) as well as session-mode pooling and the app's own pg pool. The standing constraint this buys: **no cross-transaction session state** on the backend's pooled runtime connections -- no session-scoped advisory locks (`pg_advisory_lock`; use `pg_advisory_xact_lock`), no LISTEN/NOTIFY, no temp tables, no named prepared statements. The pooled runtime uses none today; adding one later is a deliberate, reviewed decision that re-imposes session-mode-only pooling. The one deliberate exception lives outside the pool: `db-init`/`db-migrate` serialise startup with a session advisory lock (`backend/src/common/db/advisory-locks.ts`) on a dedicated `pg.Client` connection each holds for its whole run -- which is why the startup scripts must reach Postgres directly, not through a transaction-mode pooler.

## Configuration

| Env var | Purpose | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_USER` / `DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Owner role (init, migrate, seed) | `monize_user` |
| `DATABASE_APP_USER` / `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` | Unprivileged runtime role (required for `enforce`) | unset (falls back to owner) |
| `RLS_MODE` | `off` \| `shadow` \| `enforce` — one enum controls both GUC emission and the runtime role | `off` |

| `RLS_MODE` | GUCs emitted | Runtime role | Effect |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| `off` | no | owner | Identical to pre-RLS behavior. |
| `shadow` | yes | owner | Tenant transactions + GUCs live; policies bypassed (owner). Safe soak; transaction-wrapping latency shows up early. |
| `enforce` | yes | `monize_app` | Policies live **on tables where RLS is enabled**. Before the enable migration ships (flip B), this only drops privileges (flip A) and row visibility is unchanged. |

The single enum replaces an earlier two-boolean design in which "unprivileged role but no GUC emission" (zero rows everywhere) was representable. The only startup validation needed: `RLS_MODE=enforce` without `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` refuses to boot.

**Role and grants are managed entirely by `db-init` -- no migration references `monize_app`**, so migrations can never fail on a missing role and existing deployments upgrade with no new required env vars and no behavior change. On every startup (before its tables-exist early return) db-init: (1) creates/rotates `monize_app` when `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` is set, tolerating `insufficient_privilege` with a warning; (2) re-applies DML grants + default privileges idempotently whenever the role exists, however it was provisioned. If `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` is unset, db-init skips with a warning. The compose files reference the new vars with empty defaults (`${DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD:-}`) so old `.env` files neither warn nor break.

**Kubernetes/CNPG:** the owner has no `CREATEROLE`, so db-init cannot create the role there. Declare it in the CNPG `Cluster` manifest instead:

```yaml
spec:
  managed:
    roles:
      - name: monize_app
        login: true
        passwordSecret:
          name: monize-app-db-credentials
```

db-init's grant step still runs (grants require only ownership) and converges on the next restart after the role appears. `RLS_MODE` / `DATABASE_APP_USER` go in the backend ConfigMap (helm `values.yaml` + `configmap-backend.yaml`, or the kustomize overlay's `env-vars-backend`); `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` in the backend's DB Secret, matching the CNPG `passwordSecret`.

### Rotating the app-role password

`db-init` re-applies the password on **every** startup (`ALTER ROLE monize_app PASSWORD ...`, passed via a parameterized `set_config`, never string interpolation). To rotate: change `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` in the environment and restart the stack. No manual SQL needed. On CNPG, update the Secret referenced by `managed.roles.passwordSecret` instead -- CNPG reconciles it.

> Log caveat: with `log_statement = 'all'` (enabled during the staging phase below), the extended-protocol bind parameter carrying the password appears in the Postgres log at each startup. Rotate the password after the statement-logging phase, or scrub those logs.

## Session variables (GUCs)

| GUC | Type | Meaning | Set by |
|-----|------|---------|--------|
| `app.current_user_id` | uuid (as text) | The effective tenant for this transaction (the **owner** when a delegate acts) | `withScopedDb()`, transaction-locally, inside a request scope or a `withUserContext()` scope |
| `app.real_user_id` | uuid (as text) | The authenticated identity; equals `current_user_id` outside delegation. Gates the delegate-keyed tables (`users` self-row, `account_delegates` delegate side, `delegate_account_favourites`) | `withScopedDb()`, transaction-locally, alongside `app.current_user_id` (defaults to it when the context has no `realUserId`) |
| `app.bypass_rls` | `'on'` / unset | Privileged: see across all users | `withScopedDb()`, transaction-locally, inside a `withSystemContext()` scope only (import lint-allowlisted; no log line -- see below) |
| `app.preserve_timestamps` | `'on'` / unset | Backup restore: the `update_updated_at_column()` trigger leaves `updated_at` untouched | `withScopedDb()` when the context carries `preserveTimestamps: true` (backup restore path only); dies with each COMMIT. Emitted in **every** `RLS_MODE` including `off` — it replaces the old `DISABLE TRIGGER` DDL and is not an RLS feature |

All are read with the `missing_ok` form (`current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)`), so an unset value yields `NULL`/false and policies **deny** (fail closed). The helpers `app_current_user_id()` / `app_real_user_id()` return `NULL` when unset/empty; `app_bypass_rls()` returns `true` only when `app.bypass_rls = 'on'`. One nuance: a GUC holding a **non-UUID garbage** value does not silently deny -- the `::uuid` cast raises `invalid input syntax for type uuid` (22P02) and the statement errors. Still fail-closed, just loud.

Connection hygiene: none required. The GUCs are transaction-local — Postgres reverts them at COMMIT/ROLLBACK, before the connection can serve anything else. There is no reset code, no release hook, and no "destroy on failed reset" path; a pooled connection **cannot** carry a previous request's identity, by construction.

Fail-loud helper: `withScopedDb()` **throws** (`DB access outside request/user/system context`) when called with no ambient scope, in every `RLS_MODE` including `off`. There is deliberately no silent fallback — under enforcement a fallback would mean a query with no GUC, i.e. zero rows that look like empty data. A context gap is therefore a thrown error in dev/CI, not a production mystery.

## How context is set per code path

| Code path | How the GUC gets set |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Authenticated HTTP request | The existing `RequestContextInterceptor` seeds AsyncLocalStorage with `req.user.id` + `req.user.realUserId`; **every `withScopedDb()`** sets `app.current_user_id` and `app.real_user_id` for its own transaction. No connection is held between queries — SSE/streaming endpoints and requests that never touch the DB hold nothing. |
| Delegate acting for an owner | Same request path: `current_user_id` = owner, `real_user_id` = delegate. Owner-scoped tables resolve via `current`; the delegate's own rows (`users` self-row for `changePassword`, `delegate_account_favourites`, the delegate side of `account_delegates`) resolve via `real`. No bypass involved. |
| JWT validation (`jwt.strategy` — runs in the guard phase, **before** the interceptor's ALS scope exists) | `withUserContext(payload.sub)` — the verified token already names the user; the `users` self-policy and `account_delegates` delegate-side arm cover its lookups. Deliberately **not** `withSystemContext`: this is the highest-QPS query in the system and must not put bypass on the hot path. |
| PAT-authenticated request (incl. all MCP traffic) | Same as an authenticated request once resolved; the PAT **lookup itself** (token-hash scan across users) runs in `withSystemContext()`. |
| Auth bootstrap (login-by-email / OIDC callback / register / refresh — genuinely pre-identity) | `withSystemContext(fn)` |
| Password reset / email verification token lookups | `withSystemContext(fn)` |
| MCP-connector OAuth flow (`oauth_payloads` during authorize, pre-session) | **No context at all** -- `PostgresAdapter` holds a bare `DataSource`, because `node-oidc-provider` is mounted as raw Express middleware outside Nest's request pipeline. This row read `withSystemContext(fn)` for a long time and was simply wrong. The table is RLS-exempt with no owner column, so nothing depends on an identity GUC here; see `docs/row-level-security-contract.md` section 3 for what the safety argument actually is. |
| Emergency-access claim (grantee or claim token acting on the **grantor's** rows) | `withSystemContext(fn)` |
| Cron job, per-user work | `withUserContext(userId, fn)` |
| Cron job, cross-user fan-out (e.g. "all users in timezone X") | `withSystemContext(fn)` |
| Seeders / demo reset | `withSystemContext(fn)` |
| Admin (cross-user) | `withSystemContext(fn)` (or a dedicated owner DataSource if hardened) |
| Backup restore | Normal user context + `preserveTimestamps: true` context flag; `withScopedDb()` adds `app.preserve_timestamps = 'on'` to each restore transaction (replaces the old `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER` DDL, which `monize_app` cannot run). |
| Unauthenticated health check | None — direct DataSource ping, reads no user data. |
| `db-init` / `db-migrate` | None needed — they run as the owner and bypass RLS. |

This table is descriptive, not exhaustive-by-construction: the implementation includes an audit of every route reachable without `req.user`. If you add such a route later, it needs explicit context.

**Do not "fix" a zero-rows or context-error bug by adding `withSystemContext`.** That widens the RLS bypass. ESLint restricts importing `with-context.ts` to `WITH_CONTEXT_ALLOWLIST` in `backend/eslint.config.mjs` (guards/strategies, cron entry points, seeders, bootstrap hooks, admin, backup, the MCP transport, the request-context interceptor); if the lint blocks you, the almost-always-correct fix is propagating the *user* context (`withUserContext` or the request scope), and adding a file to the allowlist is a deliberate, reviewed decision made in the same PR. That allowlist is the whole control: `withSystemContext` writes no log line of its own. It used to log every invocation with its call site (rate-limited per site), but with roughly a hundred call sites -- most on request and cron paths that run constantly -- the audit trail was the backend log rather than something in it, and it caught nothing the lint had not already refused at build time. To see where a bypass runs, grep for `withSystemContext(` or read `WITH_CONTEXT_ALLOWLIST`; both answer statically and completely.

## Rollout (enabling RLS safely)

Each step is independently revertible. Do not skip the soak phases. The structure separates the two failure classes: **flip A drops privileges** (only `permission denied`-class bugs possible), **flip B enables RLS** (only zero-row/context-class bugs possible) — they can never surface in the same step.

1. **Plumbing as a no-op** — deploy with `RLS_MODE=off`. `withScopedDb` and the `withSystemContext`/`withUserContext` helpers exist but emit no GUCs. Because `withScopedDb()` throws on context-less DB access even at `off`, most context gaps already surface in dev/CI here. No behavior change.
2. **Shadow soak** — `RLS_MODE=shadow` in production. GUCs emitted per transaction, runtime still the owner (policies bypassed). Land the helper/trigger + policy migrations — policies without `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` are inert, and no migration references the app role (grants live in db-init). Soak for **weeks, not days**: the transaction wrapping proves itself (endpoint latency, error rates) while RLS itself is still off.
3. **Staging, fully enforced — not the demo alone.** The demo cannot verify the riskiest paths: `DEMO_MODE=true` makes backup **restore** and the emergency-access **claim** `@DemoRestricted` (403 before any service code). Stand up a non-demo staging stack — the prod compose with `DEMO_MODE=false` and a **pinned pre-release image tag** — at `RLS_MODE=enforce` *with* the enable migration deployed. Enable Postgres `log_statement`. Run the full e2e + integration suites, plus the four paths most likely to break: a backup **restore**, an emergency-access **claim**, an MCP request authenticated by PAT, and **delegate-acting flows** (switch account, favourite, delegate's own password change). The demo may run enforce in parallel for general-traffic soak. Image discipline for the whole rollout: prod must run a pinned release tag, **not `:latest`** — demo and prod share the same image reference today, so an unpinned prod would pull flip-B the moment it is published anywhere. Watch the monitoring signals below.
4. **Production flip A: privilege drop** — set `RLS_MODE=enforce` while the enable migration is **not** yet deployed to prod. The runtime becomes `monize_app`; no table has RLS enabled, so row visibility is unchanged. Only privilege bugs can surface (loud `permission denied` errors, e.g. a missed grant or a DDL path). Soak. Revert: `RLS_MODE=shadow`.
5. **Production flip B: enable RLS** — deploy the release containing the enable migration (`123_rls_enable.sql`, which derives its targets from `pg_policies` so tables policied after M2 are included automatically). RLS is now live; only context bugs can surface. Keep watching the signals through at least one daily-cron cycle (scheduled-transaction auto-post, demo reset). Emergency revert is unchanged and instant: `RLS_MODE=shadow` — the owner role bypasses RLS even on enabled tables.

### Monitoring signals during soak and after enforcement

- **RLS violations in the Postgres log** — should be zero in steady state: `grep 'violates row-level security' <pg log>`; each hit is a write path with wrong/missing context. (On k8s/CNPG there is no log file to grep — use `kubectl logs` on the CNPG instance pods, which emit JSON records.)
- **Permission errors** — `grep 'permission denied for' <pg log>`; a hit means a missing GRANT or a privileged operation (DDL) attempted as `monize_app`.
- **Cron comparisons on k8s:** with more than one backend replica every replica runs every cron (pre-existing behavior) — account for the duplication when comparing cron summary logs before/after a flip.
- **Context errors in the API log** — `DB access outside request/user/system context` means a call path reached the DB with no ambient scope; wrap it in `withUserContext`/`withSystemContext`. (Without the throwing accessor this would have been a silent zero-row result.)
- **Zero-row anomalies** — endpoints or crons that suddenly return/process nothing (a missing `withSystemContext`/`withUserContext`). Compare cron summary logs before/after the flip.
- **Long transactions** — `SELECT pid, now() - xact_start AS xact_age, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE xact_start IS NOT NULL ORDER BY xact_age DESC;` A `withScopedDb` should live milliseconds. A long-lived one means slow non-DB work (an LLM call, an external fetch) was wrapped inside the transaction — move it out so the transaction stays tight.
- **Latency** — compare endpoint p95 before/after the shadow flip; each simple read gained a BEGIN/COMMIT round-trip pair. Regressions localize to hot read paths that should batch into one `withScopedDb`.

## Verifying enforcement

As the unprivileged role, the GUC alone should gate visibility (bypassing the app's `WHERE user_id`):

```sql
-- Connect as monize_app (or: SET LOCAL ROLE monize_app inside a transaction as a superuser)
SET app.current_user_id = '<userA-uuid>';
SELECT count(*) FROM transactions;            -- expect: only userA's count
SET app.current_user_id = '<userB-uuid>';
SELECT count(*) FROM transactions;            -- expect: only userB's count

RESET app.current_user_id;
SELECT count(*) FROM transactions;            -- expect: 0  (fail-closed)

SET app.current_user_id = '<userA-uuid>';
INSERT INTO accounts (user_id, name, ...) VALUES ('<userB-uuid>', 'x', ...);
                                              -- expect: ERROR, new row violates row-level security policy

SET app.bypass_rls = 'on';
SELECT count(DISTINCT user_id) FROM transactions;  -- expect: all users (system/admin path works)
```

List active policies:

```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies ORDER BY tablename;
SELECT relname, relrowsecurity, relforcerowsecurity
FROM pg_class WHERE relkind = 'r' AND relrowsecurity ORDER BY relname;
```

## Rolling back

- **Emergency (instant, no DB change):** set `RLS_MODE=shadow` (or `off`) and redeploy (on k8s: ConfigMap edit + rollout restart). The API reconnects as the owner role and bypasses RLS immediately — even on tables where RLS is enabled. Policies remain in place but inert.
- **Full removal (DB change):** the migration runner is forward-only, so apply the down-SQL manually as the owner, **in this order** — `DROP ROLE` fails while sessions for the role exist:

1. Remove `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` (and set `RLS_MODE=off`) from the environment, then redeploy so nothing reconnects as `monize_app` — and so db-init does not simply recreate the role on the next restart. On CNPG, also remove the `managed.roles` entry.
2. Terminate any straggling sessions:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE usename = 'monize_app';
   ```
   (Requires superuser, `pg_signal_backend` membership, or being the same role — on CNPG run it as the `postgres` superuser via the operator, since the app owner may lack it.)
3. Run the down-SQL as the owner. Drop policies keyed on **`pg_policies`, not on which tables have RLS enabled** — the rollout deliberately creates a state where policies exist on every user-owned table (53 when M3 shipped) while zero are enabled (pre-flip-B), and `DROP FUNCTION` fails with a dependency error while any policy still references the helpers:
   ```sql
   -- Generate and run a DROP POLICY for every row of:
   SELECT format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON %I;', policyname, tablename) FROM pg_policies;
   -- Then, only where enabled:
   SELECT format('ALTER TABLE %I DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;', relname)
   FROM pg_class WHERE relkind = 'r' AND relrowsecurity;

   -- Verify SELECT count(*) FROM pg_policies is 0, then:
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS app_current_user_id();
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS app_real_user_id();
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS app_bypass_rls();
   -- Note: update_updated_at_column() stays (its GUC check is harmless without RLS).

   REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM monize_app;
   REVOKE ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public FROM monize_app;
   REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM monize_app;
   -- Run as the owner; no FOR ROLE clause (binds to the current role, whatever its name):
   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public REVOKE ALL ON TABLES FROM monize_app;
   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public REVOKE ALL ON SEQUENCES FROM monize_app;
   DROP ROLE IF EXISTS monize_app;
   ```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| API throws `DB access outside request/user/system context` | A service/cron/one-off path reached the DB with no ambient scope — previously this would have been silent zero rows | Wrap the call path in `withUserContext` (almost always right) or `withSystemContext` (only if genuinely cross-user; lint-allowlisted). |
| Every read returns 0 rows after enforcement, no errors anywhere | The query ran outside `withScopedDb` (hand-rolled QueryRunner or leftover injected repo), so no GUC was set for its transaction | Route the data access through `withScopedDb()`; confirm the lint ban on `@InjectRepository`/`createQueryRunner` covers the module. |
| A cron job suddenly processes nothing | The job runs context-less under `monize_app` | Wrap its cross-user query in `withSystemContext` and per-user work in `withUserContext`. |
| `ERROR: new row violates row-level security policy` on a legitimate write | The row's `user_id` does not match `app.current_user_id`, or the write runs without context | Ensure the writing path sets the GUC to the owning user; for system writes use `withSystemContext`. |
| Login fails after enforcement | Auth's by-email/OIDC lookup hits the `users` policy before a session exists | Wrap genuinely pre-identity reads in `withSystemContext`; `jwt.strategy` lookups belong in `withUserContext(payload.sub)` instead. |
| A delegate gets 404 on password change, or favourites vanish / can't be saved while acting for an owner | A delegate-keyed read/write ran with only `app.current_user_id` (= owner) — `app.real_user_id` missing or not used by the policy | Confirm `withScopedDb` emits both identity GUCs and the `users` / `account_delegates` / `delegate_account_favourites` policies carry the `app_real_user_id()` arm. |
| Queries error with `invalid input syntax for type uuid` on every policied table | A GUC was set to a non-UUID garbage value (bad caller of `withUserContext`, manual `SET`) | Fail-closed but loud by design. Find the caller that set the bad value; `withUserContext` should validate its argument is a UUID. |
| All MCP requests fail auth (401) or return empty after enforcement | PAT validation scans `personal_access_tokens` across users pre-session | Wrap the PAT lookup in `withSystemContext`. |
| Backup restore fails with `ERROR: must be owner of table ...` | Restore still uses the old `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER` DDL, which `monize_app` cannot run | Use the `app.preserve_timestamps` GUC path (the trigger function honors it); no DDL at restore time. |
| Emergency-access claim appears to succeed but changes nothing (or errors) | The claim flow touches the grantor's rows with the grantee's (wrong) context | Wrap the claim flow in `withSystemContext`. |
| `permission denied for table ...` (not a row error) | Missing GRANT to `monize_app` | Restart the backend — db-init re-applies grants + default privileges idempotently on every startup. Only tables created by a role other than the owner escape the default privileges. |
| Bulk report/export got slow | Per-row `EXISTS` on an indirect-table policy over a large scan | Confirm the FK index exists and the policy uses the `(SELECT app_current_user_id())` initplan form; as a last resort run that specific export under `withSystemContext`. |
| Requests queue / time out under load; `pg_stat_activity` shows `monize_app` at the pool cap | A long-lived transaction is holding connections — almost always slow non-DB work (LLM call, external fetch) wrapped inside a `withScopedDb` | Find it via the long-transaction query above; move the slow work outside the transaction so each `withScopedDb` stays milliseconds-short. |
| Suspected cross-request data bleed | Should be impossible: the GUC is transaction-local and Postgres reverts it at COMMIT/ROLLBACK | Grep for session-scoped `set_config(..., false)` calls outside `scoped-db.ts` — any hit is the bug; the `rls-enforcement` GUC-scope test asserts the revert. |

## Adding a new table later

When a migration adds a user-owned table, in the same migration (and mirrored into `database/schema.sql`):

1. `ALTER TABLE <t> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` (post-flip-B, new tables enable immediately — the staged enable was only for the initial rollout).
2. Create the isolation policy — direct (`user_id = (SELECT app_current_user_id()) OR (SELECT app_bypass_rls())`); or, if the table is keyed by another owner column (an `owner_user_id`, a delegate-side column), a bespoke policy naming that column (delegate-keyed columns compare against `app_real_user_id()`); or, if it has no owner column, an `EXISTS` against its owning parent. Keep the `(SELECT ...)` initplan form.
3. Grants are automatic via the default privileges db-init maintains **only** if the owner role created the table; verify `monize_app` has DML on it otherwise (a backend restart re-applies grants).
4. Test coverage is automatic: the catalog-driven `rls-enforcement.integration.spec.ts` enumerates tables from the schema and `pg_policies`, and **fails** if a table is in none of the four buckets — `user_id` column, owner-column map, indirect-ownership map, or exemption list. For anything but a plain `user_id` table, update the relevant map/list in the spec — that is the only manual step; forgetting it is a test failure, not a silent gap.

Similarly, any new route reachable without `req.user` (public endpoint, new auth strategy) must wrap its user-table access in `withSystemContext` — see "How context is set per code path".

Reference tables with no per-user owner (e.g. `currencies`, `exchange_rates`) are intentionally left RLS-disabled; document that choice in the migration comment.
