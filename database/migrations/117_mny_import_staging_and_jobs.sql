-- Native Microsoft Money (.mny) import, task M1.1: server-side staging for the
-- uploaded file and a job row for the background import.
--
-- Why the bytes live in the database rather than on the pod's disk: with more
-- than one backend replica the /import/mny/start call can land on a different
-- pod than the upload that produced the staged file, so the database is the only
-- store both can reach. See docs/future-plans/mny-import.md, ADR-2.
--
-- The staged bytes are the DECRYPTED Money file. The user's Money password is a
-- request-scoped multipart field on the parse call and is never persisted, so a
-- staged row cannot leak it. Rows are deleted when the import completes and
-- swept by a TTL cron (ADR-2), which is why expires_at is NOT NULL.
