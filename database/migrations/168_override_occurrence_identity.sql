-- Renumbered from prefix 166 to 168. Two merged pull requests each claimed 166,
-- and a duplicate prefix leaves apply order to alphabetical tie-breaking rather
-- than to the number that is supposed to decide it.
--
-- `schema_migrations` keys on filename, so a rename makes this file run once
-- more on any database that already applied it. That is safe here, and it is why
-- this is the half of the pair that moved: the DELETE keeps the newest row per
-- slot and so matches nothing on a second pass, and every DDL statement below is
-- guarded. Its former pair, `166_heal_loan_schedule_end_dates.sql`, must NEVER
-- be renamed: it steps a loan's end_date back one interval and cannot exclude
-- its own result, so a second run would retire the schedule a payment early. It
-- is registered in NON_RERUNNABLE_DATA_MIGRATIONS under that filename.
--
-- Issue #1247 re-audit: the override table's uniqueness described the wrong
-- column, and was therefore wrong in both directions at once.
--
-- An occurrence's IDENTITY is its recurrence slot, `(scheduled_transaction_id,
-- original_date)` -- that is what every read keys on (`overridesForOccurrence`
-- and the `byOriginal` map in backend/src/common/scheduled-occurrences.ts), and
-- what `createOverride` refuses a second of. `override_date` is the date the
-- occurrence was MOVED to: an attribute of the override, not its name.
--
-- The table carried `UNIQUE (scheduled_transaction_id, override_date)`, so:
--
--   * Two overrides could exist for one occurrence, as long as they had been
--     moved to different days. Two rows claiming to replace the same slot, and
--     the reader picks whichever the map's insertion order happens to keep --
--     so the amount, category and date a posting uses were decided by row
--     order. `createOverride`'s SELECT-then-INSERT was the only thing standing
--     between the API and that state, and a SELECT is not a lock: two
--     concurrent creates for one slot both saw no existing row and both wrote.
--
--   * Two DIFFERENT occurrences of one schedule could not be moved onto the
--     same day, which is an ordinary thing to want (pay the 1st and the 15th
--     together on the 10th) and was refused with a raw 500 from the driver.
--
-- Nothing reads by `override_date`, so its uniqueness bought nothing; the
-- lookup index this replaces (`idx_sched_txn_overrides_orig`) covers exactly
-- the new constraint's columns, so the constraint's own index takes over.

-- 1. Collapse the rows the missing constraint allowed. The most recently
--    updated row for a slot is the one the user last saved; the id breaks a tie
--    deterministically (`updated_at` is transaction start time, so a single
--    transaction's rows all share it). Idempotent: after this runs, no slot has
--    a second row for the DELETE to find.
--
--    The tiebreak must be TOTAL, which means it cannot contain a NULL.
--    `updated_at` is nullable on this table and the backup restore writes it
--    explicitly (under `withPreserveTimestamps`) rather than letting the default
--    apply, so a NULL is reachable -- and a row comparison against one is NULL,
--    not false: neither direction wins, NEITHER duplicate is deleted, and the
--    ADD CONSTRAINT two statements down then fails with "could not create unique
--    index". A migration that aborts takes container start-up with it and
--    surfaces only as "backend exited (1)".

-- 2. The occurrence's identity, in the one place a duplicate cannot get past.

-- 3. Retire the old constraint. Found by its COLUMNS rather than by name:
--    PostgreSQL generated the name and truncated it to 63 characters, so
--    spelling the truncation here is a guess that fails silently on a database
--    whose name differs by a byte -- leaving the wrong rule in force with a
