-- 150: emergency-access delivery state belongs to one grant cycle, not to the row.
--
-- Migration 149 added `claim_notified_at` so a resumed grant could tell a contact
-- who already holds a working link from one still owed a notice. That fixed the
-- resume, and made the marker permanent: `contactsAwaitingNotice` selected
-- `claim_notified_at IS NULL`, and nothing ever set it back to NULL (audit
-- RRV4-004).
--
-- So emergency access fired at most once per contact row, for the lifetime of the
-- row. The owner returns, `revokeAfterReturn` voids the links and clears
-- `granted_at` -- logging that monitoring is re-armed -- and the next time the
-- owner goes quiet past `grant_after_days` the pending query finds nobody and the
-- cron skips the grant. Silently, with the settings page still showing the feature
-- as armed. The same happens after a disable/re-enable, after a manual reset, and
-- for a contact whose address was corrected after they were notified.
--
-- Clearing the marker in each of those paths is the obvious fix and the wrong one:
-- there are five of them today, they live in three files, and the failure of a
-- missed one is invisible. The state is therefore *generational* instead:
--
--   emergency_access_settings.grant_generation        -- which grant cycle this
--                                                       owner is on. Advanced by
--                                                       the one statement that
--                                                       transitions ungranted ->
--                                                       granted, so no re-arm path
--                                                       has to remember anything.
--
--   emergency_access_contacts.notified_grant_generation
--                                                    -- the cycle whose notice this
--                                                       contact received. Owed a
--                                                       link whenever it differs
--                                                       from the owner's current
--                                                       generation.
--
-- `claim_notified_at` stays, demoted to "when the notice for
-- `notified_grant_generation` went out" -- a timestamp for operators, no longer a
-- predicate. The pair is written by one statement (`markContactNotified`) and read
-- by one query (`contactsAwaitingNotice`), which is what keeps them from drifting.
--
-- Backfill: every existing installation is on generation 1 (the column default),
-- so a contact migration 149 could confirm was delivered to belongs to the cycle
-- that is current now, and `notified_grant_generation = 1` says so. The next grant
-- advances to 2 and owes them a link again, which is the whole point.
--
-- Note what is deliberately *not* inferred: a contact with a token hash but no
-- `claim_notified_at` stays NULL here, for the same reason migration 149 refused to
-- treat a hash as evidence of delivery. **State the consequence plainly, because it
-- is a user-visible upgrade effect rather than a no-op:** a contact who was sent a
-- link under the previous release and has not opened it is still owed one here, so
-- the first daily sweep after the upgrade issues a fresh link and the one in their
-- inbox stops working. That is the deliberate trade migration 149 argues for -- a
-- link that is known to work beats one nobody can confirm -- and it belongs in the
-- release notes, not only in a migration header.
