-- 140: Database-enforced guards for the concurrency defects the Phase 4 audit
-- confirmed. Each one replaces an application-level check-then-act that two
-- replicas, two tabs or a retry could both pass.
--
-- Six independent guards, all idempotent:
--
--   1. job_claims          -- the one durable claim mechanism for per-user work
--                             that must happen at most once however many
--                             replicas fire the cron (P4-013, P4-014, P4-018).
--   2. import_jobs         -- a status CHECK and a partial unique index, so
--                             "one active import per user" is enforced by the
--                             database instead of by a count() before an insert
--                             (P4-001), plus a data_committed checkpoint that
--                             tells a retry whether the first run already wrote
--                             the ledger (P4-002).
--   3. scheduled_transaction_postings -- an occurrence key, so one due date
--                             posts one transaction (P4-004).
--   4. budget_alerts       -- a unique fingerprint matching the app's own
--                             de-duplication rule, so two alert processors
--                             cannot both insert the same alert and both email
--                             it (P4-015).
--   5. transaction_attachments -- an index supporting the parent-locked cap
--                             count (P4-017).
--   6. attachment_blob_tombstones -- a deletion record for bytes PostgreSQL
--                             cannot roll back, written by a trigger so the
--                             ON DELETE CASCADE path is covered too (P4-010).
--
-- Behaviour-neutral at RLS_MODE=off. All three new tables ship their policy AND
-- their own ENABLE, per the post-123 convention the T1 harness enforces.
--
-- Two of the guards are constraints over data that already exists, and both are
-- constraints against a state the old code could reach: more than one active
-- import per user, and duplicate budget alerts. A `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` over a
-- table already in that state fails -- and a failed migration is not a failed
-- check, because `db-migrate` runs at container start, so the backend never
-- boots and the deploy reports only "backend exited (1)". Each of those two
-- guards is therefore preceded by a documented repair phase that says exactly
-- which row survives and what happens to the rest. Both repairs are
-- re-runnable: after the first pass their queries select nothing.
-- `backend/test/integration/migration-140-preflight.integration.spec.ts` seeds
-- the legacy states and asserts the migration completes and repairs them.

    -- NULL means a permanent claim (a delivery); a timestamp means a lease that
    -- a later worker may retake once it has passed.
    expires_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- The whole point of the table: the claim is one atomic statement, so there is
-- no window between a replica deciding to send and recording that it did.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. import_jobs: status CHECK, active-job uniqueness, commit checkpoint
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Set inside the import transaction itself, so it commits with the rows it
-- describes. That is what makes the difference between "the run failed before
-- writing anything, retry is free" and "the ledger is already written and only
-- the completion metadata is missing" -- states the old retryable flag folded
-- into one and offered as an ordinary retry.
--
-- Added before the repair below, which reads it to decide whether a superseded
-- job may be offered as a retry.
ALTER TABLE import_jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS data_committed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

-- PREFLIGHT (1 of 2): statuses the new CHECK would refuse.
--
-- A constraint added to a populated table validates every existing row, so a
-- status outside the four the application writes -- a hand-edited row, a value
-- from a version of the code that predates this vocabulary -- aborts the
-- migration. And an aborted migration is not a failed check: `db-migrate` runs
-- at container start, so the backend never comes up and the deploy reports only
-- "backend exited (1)". Normalize first, then constrain.
--
-- 'failed' is the honest landing place: the row describes a run nobody is
-- driving, and it is not retryable if its data is already in the ledger.
UPDATE import_jobs
   SET status = 'failed',
       error_key = CASE WHEN data_committed THEN 'mnyJobStalledAfterCommit'
                        ELSE 'mnyJobStalled' END,
       error_detail = 'Import job carried a status this version does not recognize',
       retryable = (data_committed = false),
       progress = NULL,
       completed_at = COALESCE(completed_at, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
 WHERE status IS NULL
    OR status NOT IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed');

-- The CHECK is load-bearing for the partial index below, not cosmetic: the
-- index's predicate names two statuses, so a typo'd status written by
-- application code would sit outside the predicate and let a second active job
-- exist while still looking active to hasActiveJob().
ALTER TABLE import_jobs DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS import_jobs_status_check;
ALTER TABLE import_jobs ADD CONSTRAINT import_jobs_status_check
    CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed'));

-- PREFLIGHT (2 of 2): the duplicates the new unique index would refuse.
--
-- "More than one active import for one user" is precisely the state this index
-- exists to prevent, so any database that ran the racy `hasActiveJob()` check
-- can already be in it -- and `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` on a table that is already
-- in it fails. The guard cannot be introduced without saying what happens to
-- the rows that predate it.
--
-- Keep exactly one job per user and fail the rest. The one kept is the one most
-- likely to be real work, in this order:
--
--   1. `data_committed` -- a job that has written to the ledger is the one whose
--      completion path still matters; never discard it in favour of a pristine
--      duplicate.
--   2. 'running' over 'pending' -- a worker picked it up.
--   3. the most recent heartbeat -- among running jobs, the live one.
--   4. the newest -- an arbitrary but stable tie-break.
--
-- The losers are failed with the same keys the stale-job reaper uses, so the UI
-- copy and the Retry gating are already right: `mnyJobStalledAfterCommit` and
-- `retryable = false` for a job whose data is in, `mnyJobStalled` and a genuine
-- retry for one whose is not. Those two literals are owned by
-- `backend/src/import/mny/mny-import-job.service.ts`
-- (`JOB_STALLED_ERROR_KEY` / `JOB_COMMITTED_STALLED_ERROR_KEY`); a rename there
-- has to change them here.
--
-- Re-runnable: after the first pass no user has two active jobs, so the CTE
-- returns nothing.

-- 4. budget_alerts: the app's de-duplication rule as a database key
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- PREFLIGHT: the duplicates the fingerprint would refuse.
--
-- `deduplicateAlerts()` ran in application code with no key under it, which is
-- the whole finding (P4-015) -- so on any database that has had two alert
-- processors overlap, the duplicate rows are already there and the unique index
-- cannot be created over them.
--
-- Alerts are notifications, so collapsing a duplicate set to one row loses
-- nothing except the duplicate. What must survive is anything the user did with
-- it: keep the row that was dismissed, then the one that was read, then the one
-- whose email went out, then the oldest -- the one they actually saw.
-- Deleting the others cannot orphan anything: no table references
-- `budget_alerts`.
--
-- Re-runnable: after the first pass no fingerprint has two rows.
--
-- Guarded on the table's existence because migration 179 renames budget_alerts
-- to `notifications`. A database old enough to need this repair still calls it
-- budget_alerts and runs the body exactly as it always did; one that has already
-- reached 179 -- a fresh install built from schema.sql, and the replay CI runs
-- on top of it -- has nothing here to repair, and the statements would fail on a
-- table that no longer exists. PL/pgSQL plans a statement only when it is
-- reached, which is what makes the guard work at all: naming a missing table
-- outside a DO block is a parse error, not a skipped branch.

-- Local-filesystem and S3 attachment bytes cannot be rolled back with
-- PostgreSQL, and deleting them *before* the metadata delete commits meant a
-- rollback left metadata pointing at bytes that were already gone. Worse,
-- deleting a transaction removes its attachment metadata by ON DELETE CASCADE
-- with no application code running at all, so those objects were never deleted
-- and accumulated unbounded (audit P4-010).
--
-- A tombstone written by a trigger covers every deletion path -- API delete,
-- parent-transaction cascade, restore wipe, account deletion -- because it is
-- the database that knows a row went away.
--
-- This migration ships the *record* only. There is no sweeper in this release and
-- nothing reads the table yet; reclaiming the bytes is manual until one lands.
-- Stated rather than implied, because a comment describing a component that does
-- not exist is how the missing half stops being noticed.
--
-- Whatever sweeper lands must re-check `transaction_attachments` for a live row
-- with the same (storage_provider, storage_key) before deleting: the unique index
-- below keys a tombstone by object, so an object deleted and later re-uploaded
-- under the same key has one tombstone and one live attachment. It must also
-- delete the object before dropping the row, so a crash between the two costs a
-- retry rather than metadata pointing at bytes that are gone.

-- their bytes most need removing, so the tombstone must outlive them.
