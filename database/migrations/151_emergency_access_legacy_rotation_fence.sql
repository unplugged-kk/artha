-- 151: refuse a generation-blind token rotation that would kill a delivered link.
--
-- Migrations 149 and 150 add the delivery columns and the grant generation, and
-- both land in the same release as the code that writes them -- so no binary exists
-- that knows one and not the other, and nothing has to translate between them. The
-- binary that genuinely differs is the release running in production today, which
-- predates all three columns and writes none of them. Its grant loop is:
--
--     UPDATE emergency_access_contacts
--        SET claim_token_hash = $1, claim_token_expires_at = $2,
--            claim_token_used_at = NULL, claim_voided_reason = NULL
--      WHERE id = $3
--
-- guarded only by a snapshot read of `emergency_access_settings.granted_at`. During
-- a rolling deploy a stale old pod can take that snapshot before the new pod's
-- grant commits, then rotate the hash *after* the new pod has minted, delivered and
-- recorded a link -- so the link already in the recipient's inbox dies silently,
-- which is exactly the P4-014 outcome the generation machinery exists to end. The
-- old binary acknowledges nothing, so nothing that waits for an acknowledgement
-- would ever see this write.
--
-- The rule has to live where both binaries meet, so it is a BEFORE UPDATE trigger.
-- What separates the binaries at the SQL level is the credential protocol: the
-- current code never writes a new `claim_token_hash` without writing the matching
-- `claim_token_ciphertext` in the same statement (`credentialFor` commits the pair
-- together, and `markContactNotified` clears the ciphertext only alongside the
-- generation). The legacy binary predates both columns, so its rotation changes
-- neither. A "legacy-shaped rotation" is therefore: a new non-NULL hash, with the
-- ciphertext and the notified generation both left untouched.
--
-- Such a rotation is refused only when it would destroy new-protocol state:
--
--   1. `claim_token_ciphertext IS NOT NULL` -- an undelivered credential is in
--      flight. Overwriting the hash desyncs the pair, so the retry would either
--      re-send a link whose hash is gone (a dead link recorded as delivered) or
--      rotate again and kill whichever link the old pod just emailed.
--   2. a live, unconsumed, unexpired link whose delivery the new protocol has
--      recorded (`notified_grant_generation IS NOT NULL`) -- the exact race above:
--      the recipient is holding this link, and the blind rotation kills it.
--
-- Everything else passes. Setting the hash to NULL (revocation, disable, claim
-- consumption) is never a rotation; a rotation over a row with no new-protocol
-- state is the legacy binary retrying its own legacy grant, which stays exactly as
-- correct or incorrect as it is on current main; and a rotation over an expired or
-- consumed link destroys nothing anyone can use. In particular a pure rollback to
-- the old binary keeps working, except in the two states above -- where the old
-- pod's per-contact try/catch logs the refusal and retries daily, which is loud,
-- while the alternative is a silently dead link during an account recovery. The
-- rollout/drain trade-off and the rollback consequence are written up for operators
-- in docs/cron-jobs.md, under "Emergency access".
--
-- No SECURITY DEFINER: the decision reads only OLD and NEW, no other table.
--
-- Idempotent: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION, and the trigger is dropped first.
