# Database Directory

## Overview
PostgreSQL schema definition and incremental migration scripts for the monize database.

A constraint here is usually the strongest available form of a system rule, so several entries in [`docs/system-invariants.md`](../docs/system-invariants.md) are enforced -- or unenforced -- by what is in `schema.sql`. `database/migrations/135_import_jobs_single_active.sql` is the model: a partial unique index doing what a read-then-insert in the service could not, with the reasoning in the migration's own header. See [`docs/concurrency-and-idempotency.md`](../docs/concurrency-and-idempotency.md) for when a constraint is the right mechanism -- and note that a uniqueness constraint prevents duplicate *rows* and does nothing about a lost update to one.

## Files
- `schema.sql` - Full database schema (used for fresh installs). Must be kept in sync with all migrations.
- `migrations/` - Incremental SQL migration files. Applied automatically on app startup by `db-migrate`.

## Automatic Migrations

Migrations run automatically when the backend starts (dev and production). `db-migrate`: creates a `schema_migrations` tracking table if absent, reads all `.sql` files from `migrations/`, compares against applied migrations, runs pending ones in prefix order (numeric on the prefix, then the full filename; each in a transaction), and records each success.

**Fresh installs:** `db-init` runs `schema.sql` first (which includes `schema_migrations`), then `db-migrate` runs all migrations -- no-ops on a fresh schema because they use `IF NOT EXISTS`. **Existing installs:** `db-init` skips, `db-migrate` applies only new migrations.

## Development Database Connection
Credentials are in the root `.env` file (`POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`).

## Creating a New Migration

1. **Create the migration file** in `database/migrations/` named `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`, where the prefix is the **UTC** second you authored it:
   ```bash
   touch "database/migrations/$(date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)_heal_something.sql"
   ```
   - **Do not take the next sequential number.** The `NNN_` prefixes are the retired scheme: a counter two branches can both read is how prefixes collided eight times (`022`, `068`, `075`, `116`, `117`, `124`, then `165` and `166` within nine hours of each other -- issue #1277). Two authors cannot generate the same second, so a timestamp needs no coordination and no check. `scripts/check-migration-prefixes.mjs` refuses a new `NNN_` file, in CI and locally (`node scripts/check-migration-prefixes.mjs`).
   - **The three-digit files are historical and are never renumbered.** `schema_migrations` keys on the filename, so a renamed migration re-runs on every deployed database -- and `166_heal_loan_schedule_end_dates.sql` is a registered one-shot data repair whose second pass retires a schedule one payment early. The two forms coexist; apply order is **numeric on the prefix** everywhere migrations are ordered (`backend/src/common/db/migration-filename.ts` is the one definition), so every timestamp sorts after every three-digit prefix. A string sort agrees only by the coincidence that historical prefixes begin with 0 or 1 and timestamps with 2; the runner does not rely on it, and `migration-filename.spec.ts` fails on a bare `.sort()` over a migrations listing.
   - **Apply order is authoring order, not merge order.** A migration authored earlier but merged later replays first on a fresh install while an upgraded database ran it last. That was equally true of the counter (it is exactly how the `165`/`166` pairs arose); it is only more visible now. So a migration must not depend on the ordering of another *in-flight* migration -- if yours needs an object another open PR creates, wait for that PR to merge and author yours after it.
   - Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS` to make migrations idempotent
2. **Update `schema.sql`** to reflect the same change (so fresh installs match migrated databases)
3. **Update the backend TypeORM entity** if the migration modifies a mapped table. DB columns are `snake_case`, entity properties `camelCase`, mapped via `@Column({ name: 'snake_case_name' })`.
4. **Update the backend DTO** if the field should be user-editable (class-validator decorators)
5. **Update frontend types** in `frontend/src/types/` to match
6. **Classify any new column in the support backup** if its table is exported -- `backend/src/backup/support-backup/support-backup-rules.ts`. `RULES` is an allowlist (an unclassified column is dropped, not leaked), but the golden test in `backend/test/integration/support-backup.integration.spec.ts` fails until you classify it deliberately -- forcing a decision instead of letting a migration quietly change what a de-identified backup contains. Pick `keep` for structure, dates, enums, flags and FKs; `mask` for names; `drop` for free text, secrets, and anything that re-identifies a value masked elsewhere (a URL beside a masked name names the thing the mask hides -- why `payees.website`, `securities.website` and `securities.msn_instrument_id` are all dropped). Use `const` instead of `drop` when the column is NOT NULL.
7. **Ship the table's RLS policy in the same migration** if the table is user-owned -- see below. This is a hard convention.
8. **Restart the backend** -- migrations apply automatically on startup

## Row-Level Security conventions (hard rules)

Every user-owned table carries a row-level-security policy; the app emits per-transaction identity GUCs through `withScopedDb` and the policies compare each row's owner against them (see `docs/future-plans/row-level-security.md` and the runbook). Two rules bind every migration:

1. **A migration that creates a user-owned table ships its `CREATE POLICY` in the same file** -- `117_mny_import_staging_and_jobs.sql` and `118_security_documents_rls.sql` are the worked examples. Because `123_rls_enable.sql` derives its `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` targets from `pg_policies` *at the moment it runs* and never runs again on a deployed database, any migration numbered after `123` must also ship its own `ALTER TABLE <t> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` -- a later policy without it leaves that table as the single unprotected one under enforcement. (Enabling is inert at `RLS_MODE=off`/`shadow`, so shipping it does not change behavior before the operator flips modes.)

   Every table lands in exactly one of **four buckets**, and the catalog-driven `backend/test/integration/rls-enforcement.integration.spec.ts` fails the moment a table is in none (or several):
   - **Direct**: has a `user_id` column -> the uniform policy (`user_id = (SELECT app_current_user_id()) OR (SELECT app_bypass_rls())`), picked up with no spec change. Tables keyed by the *authenticated* user additionally OR in `user_id = (SELECT app_real_user_id())` -- see `112_rls_policies_direct.sql` Group B.
   - **Owner-column**: a bespoke owner column (`owner_user_id`, `delegate_user_id`, `users.id`) -> bespoke policy (`114_rls_policies_special.sql`), plus an entry in the spec's owner-column map.
   - **Indirect**: no owner column -> an `EXISTS` back to the owning parent (`113_rls_policies_indirect.sql`), plus an entry in the spec's indirect map.
   - **Exempt**: no owner column to policy on. The set is `RLS_EXEMPT_TABLES` in `backend/src/common/db/rls-exempt-tables.ts`, mirrored as `rls-exempt:` marker lines in `database/schema.sql` and checked in both directions (with no database) by `backend/src/common/db/rls-exempt-tables.spec.ts`. Do not write the list out anywhere else -- it was previously kept in five places and had drifted. Exempting a table takes a rationale in `docs/row-level-security-contract.md`, which is canonical.

   Keep the `(SELECT app_current_user_id())` initplan form -- a bare function call relies on SQL-function inlining and evaluates per row on sequential scans.

2. **No migration may name a role.** `GRANT ... TO monize_app` (or any `CREATE/ALTER/DROP ROLE`) in a migration crash-loops every deployment where the role does not exist. The role and its grants are provisioned idempotently by db-init on every startup (`backend/src/common/db/app-role.ts`); on CNPG the role comes from the `Cluster` manifest (`managed.roles`). New tables created by the owner get grants automatically via `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`. The `role-or-grant-statement` rule in `backend/scripts/migration-lint.mjs` enforces this in CI.

   **`PUBLIC` is the exception, for the same reason and not in spite of it:** it is a keyword that always resolves, so it cannot fail for a missing role. It has to be permitted, because `CREATE FUNCTION` grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC` implicitly -- revoking that anywhere but the transaction that created the function leaves a window in which any role can execute a fresh `SECURITY DEFINER` function. `136_currency_global_liveness.sql` is the case.

## Migration File Conventions
- Timestamp prefix for ordering: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`, UTC (a migration authored at 2026-09-05 14:30:00 UTC starts 20260905143000_). The `NNN_` prefixes (e.g., `079_securities_is_favourite.sql`) are historical; do not create new ones
- Use `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`
- Include a comment at the top describing the change
- Keep migrations small and focused on a single change
- Migrations must be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## Idempotency is a CI gate

Every statement must be a no-op when re-applied to an up-to-date database -- a half-applied migration otherwise crash-loops the backend at startup. Two checks enforce it, and `docs/database-migrations.md` holds the guard recipes (`ADD CONSTRAINT` needs a preceding `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS`, `CREATE TRIGGER` a `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` or a `pg_trigger` `DO` block, `INSERT` an `ON CONFLICT`, ...) plus the recovery runbook for a failed migration:

- `cd backend && npm run migration:lint` -- static guard check, run in the "Backend Lint & Type Check" job (`backend/scripts/migration-lint.mjs`).
- `scripts/verify-schema.sh` -- applies every migration on top of `schema.sql` **twice** and diffs the result, run in the "Schema vs Migrations Drift" job.

## Tables

`schema.sql` is the authoritative source. Use it (or the TypeORM entities under `backend/src/*/entities/`) to look up table and column definitions rather than maintaining a duplicate list here.
