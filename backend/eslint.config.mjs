 * reviewed decision, not a drive-by fix: add the file here, in the same PR,
 * with a justification in the PR description. The list was derived from the
 * real tree when the R1-R7 refactors finished (guards/strategies, cron
 * entry points, seeders, bootstrap hooks, admin, backup, the MCP transport,
 * and the interceptor that seeds request scope) -- every entry wraps an
 * out-of-request call path or a genuinely cross-user sweep documented in
