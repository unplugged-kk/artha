/**
 * Every production path that reaches `oauth_payloads` is named here.
 *
 * `oauth_payloads` is the one *application* table read and written without
 * `withScopedDb`. `node-oidc-provider` is mounted as raw Express middleware
 * (`backend/src/main.ts`), outside the Nest request pipeline, so
 * `PostgresAdapter` holds a bare `DataSource` and runs with no ambient identity
 * at all -- not `withSystemContext`, as migration 114, the foot of
 * `database/schema.sql`, the RLS runbook and the C1 task record each claimed
 * for over a year. Nothing checked, so nothing noticed.
 *
 * That is safe only because the table is RLS-exempt, has no owner column, and
 * is keyed by opaque provider ids. It is **not** precedent for a user-owned
 * table, and the risk this guard exists for is a future service quietly
 * treating it as one. `docs/row-level-security-contract.md` is the boundary,
 * the rejected alternatives and the review triggers.
 *
 * Two layers, because neither alone is enough. `eslint.config.mjs` bans the
 * *import* outside `OAUTH_PAYLOAD_ALLOWLIST`; this spec covers what an import
 * ban cannot see -- a barrel or re-export laundering the entity (there is no
 * `index.ts` under `src/oauth/` today, and this fails if one appears), and raw
 * SQL naming the table directly, which involves no import at all.
 *
 * The inventory comes from `git ls-files`, not a hardcoded file list, so a file
 * split or rename cannot disarm it -- the failure mode `backend/CLAUDE.md`
 * describes, where four guards went on passing while scanning code that had
 * moved out from under them.
 *
 * It lists untracked-but-not-ignored files too (`--others --exclude-standard`),
 * because the file this guard most wants to see is the one being added right
 * now. A tracked-only inventory passed cleanly against a barrel re-exporting
 * the entity purely because the barrel had not been `git add`ed yet -- green
 * locally, red in CI, which is the wrong way round for a guard whose job is to
 * make the author stop and think.
