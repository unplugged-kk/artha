/**
 * Decides which request paths are handled by node-oidc-provider.
 *
 * The provider is mounted at the application root (not under `/oauth`) because
 * its issuer is the bare origin, so the discovery documents live at the root
 * well-known URLs. Its actual endpoints are kept under `/oauth/*` via the
 * provider's `routes` map (see `OAuthProviderService.initialize`). This
 * predicate is the routing gate for the root mount in `main.ts`: a request is
 * delegated to the provider only when it targets one of those paths, and every
 * other request falls through to the normal Nest router.
 *
 * Kept in its own module so the routing rule is unit-testable (main.ts is
 * excluded from coverage).
 *
 * NOTE: the frontend proxy (`frontend/src/proxy.ts` -> `isOAuthPath`) must
 * forward the same set of paths to the backend; keep the two lists in sync.
