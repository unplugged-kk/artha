/**
 * Identity smoke for Shared Access, run against the REAL `withScopedDb` at
 * `RLS_MODE=enforce` -- the mode the deployment this was reported from runs in.
 *
 * `delegation.service.spec.ts` mocks `withScopedDb` away, which is right for
 * asserting what the service computes and structurally blind to which identity
 * it computes it under. That blindness is the whole bug: every read below was
 * issued under the caller's own scope, and `users_self` answers a question
 * about somebody else's row with zero rows rather than an error. Nothing threw,
 * nothing logged, and the Add-delegate form quietly reported an existing Monize
 * account as new.
 *
 * So these tests assert the identity, twice over and at two different levels:
 * the ambient context each repository call actually ran in, and the `set_config`
 * statements `withScopedDb` emitted for it. A read that regresses to `scoped()`
 * fails on both.
 *
 * The pairing matters as much as the bypass. An owner-side read is expected to
 * bypass ONLY after the authorization read that licenses it has run under the
 * owner's own scope -- so the tests assert the whole ordered sequence of
 * identities, not merely that a bypass appears somewhere in it.
