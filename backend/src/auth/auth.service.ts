   * this write is the one that moved the row from not-locked to locked.
   *
   * Two things this fixes, both from the maintainer review of PR #1097:
   *
   * 1. **The increment and the lock were two transactions.** The counter grew
   *    in one committed statement and `locked_until` was written by a second,
   *    so a concurrent attempt could interleave between them -- a legitimate
   *    user locked out on a stale count, or the lockout window written from a
   *    count that a parallel failure had already moved past. Folding the
   *    threshold `CASE` into the increment makes the decision atomic with the
   *    value it is decided from.
   * 2. **The lockout email fired per failed attempt above the threshold, not
   *    per transition.** Every committed count `>= MAX` looked lockable, so two
   *    parallel failures both mailed the victim for one lockout. Only the write
   *    that actually crossed from not-locked to locked reports `justLocked`, by
   *    comparing the pre-update `locked_until` (returned from a CTE, since
   *    `RETURNING` sees only the post-update row) against the new one.
   *
   * The lockout window keeps the exponential backoff the application code used
   * (`BASE_LOCKOUT_MS * 2^(floor(attempts / MAX) - 1)`), computed in SQL from
   * the committed count so it matches the value the same statement wrote.
   *
   * Returns `attempts: 0` / `justLocked: false` when no row matched, so a caller
   * cannot mistake a missing user for a first failed attempt.
