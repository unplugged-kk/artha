/**
 * The authorization-scope vocabulary, defined once.
 *
 * It had four copies: the `personal_access_tokens.scopes` comment in
 * `schema.sql`, the regex in `CreatePatDto`, the `monize:`-prefixed list the
 * OAuth provider advertises, and prose in a feature plan. The schema comment and
 * the plan named a `reports` scope no issuance path had ever accepted, so a
 * client reading either was told about a scope `POST /auth/pats` rejects. A
 * vocabulary spread across four files drifts silently; derive from here instead
 * of restating.
 *
 * `read` and `write` are the whole set. A PAT presents them bare; an OAuth client
 * presents them resource-prefixed (`monize:read`) and `OAuthProviderService`
 * strips the prefix, so both surfaces reach `requireScope` and `PatScopeGuard`
 * with the same strings. Adding a scope means adding it here and to
 * `frontend/src/components/settings/ApiAccessSection.tsx`; `scopes.spec.ts`
 * checks that every consumer in this repository agrees.
