 * removing the fields it happened to remember -- five call sites, five different
 * removal lists, and not one of them dropped `backupPasswordEnc`. A removal list
 * is the wrong shape for this: a column added to the entity is included by
 * default, and only an author who thinks to revisit five spread expressions
 * excludes it. So this is an **allowlist**: a new column is absent from every
 * response until someone names it here.
 *
 * `PROFILE_FIELDS` is the whole contract, and `user-profile.spec.ts` proves it
 * against class-transformer's `@Exclude()` metadata, so a newly excluded column
 * that leaks through here fails the suite rather than shipping.
 *
 * Never add a field whose value is a credential, a token, a pending
 * verification/linking secret, or ciphertext -- those exist so the server can
 * finish a workflow, and no client needs them. `hasPassword` is the sanctioned
 * shape for that kind of fact: a boolean derived from the secret, never the
 * secret.
