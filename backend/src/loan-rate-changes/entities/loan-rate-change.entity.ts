/**
 * A point on a loan/mortgage account's interest-rate timeline. These rows are
 * the record of what the loan's terms ARE: the rate in effect on any date is the
 * latest row not dated in the future (`resolveCurrentTimeline`).
 *
 * The account's scalar `interestRate` / `paymentAmount` are **not** denormalized
 * from them and never written by this module -- they stay user-owned, settable
 * only from the account edit form, so that recording a rate change or running
 * detection cannot clobber a manually set value. The two therefore diverge
 * routinely: after any change entered through the rate-history UI the scalars
 * hold the OLD terms. Anything projecting a loan forward reads the timeline, not
 * the scalars (frontend `buildLoanProjectionInput`); the scalars are the
 * fallback for a loan with no recorded history.
 *
 * 'initial' rows snapshot the origination rate the first time a change is
 * recorded; 'inferred' rows are produced by detection from payment history.
 * A null newPaymentAmount means the payment did not change with the rate.
 *
 * One asymmetry matters to consumers: an 'initial' row's `newPaymentAmount` is a
 * verbatim copy of `account.paymentAmount` at the time it was written
 * (`insertInitialRowIfFirst`), so it is a snapshot of that field rather than an
 * independent statement about what is being paid. 'manual' and 'inferred'
 * payments do state it -- detection writes null outright when interest is booked
 * separately, precisely so a principal-only observation never becomes one.
