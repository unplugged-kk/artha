/**
 * Tells the deployment's administrators when a market-data provider has stopped
 * answering, and when it comes back -- once per outage, not once per failure.
 *
 * Before this, a provider outage was something an operator discovered from the
 * application being unusable and then from a log of `TypeError: fetch failed`
 * repeated thousands of times (issue #1265). The alert is the other half of the
 * circuit breaker: the breaker stops the flood, and the flood was also the only
 * signal anybody had.
 *
 * Three separate mechanisms keep it off the "another monitoring email" pile, and
 * they are separate on purpose -- each one alone has a hole:
 *
 * 1. **A minimum outage** (`MIN_OUTAGE_MS`), read from durable state, so a blip
 *    or a restart never mails anybody.
 * 2. **One notice per episode**: `outage_notified_at` is claimed with a
 *    conditional UPDATE, so however many replicas fire this cron, one of them
 *    sends. The recovery notice clears the marker, which is what makes the pair
 *    at most one-and-one per episode.
 * 3. **A quiet period** (`ALERT_QUIET_PERIOD_MS`) on `last_notified_at`, which
 *    nothing clears, so a flapping provider cannot mail its way around (2).
 *
 * The claim is taken *before* the send, which makes the alert **at most once**:
 * a process killed between the UPDATE committing and SMTP accepting loses that
 * notice. That is the right way round for this particular email -- a duplicated
 * alert is the failure mode being designed against, the outage stays in the log
 * and in `provider_health`, and a still-broken provider becomes notifiable again
 * once the quiet period elapses. It is the opposite trade from
 * `BillReminderService`, which would rather send twice than miss a mortgage
 * renewal; `docs/external-side-effects.md` records both.
