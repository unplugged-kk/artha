   * -- leaves snapshots that disagree with the ledger and nothing that will ever
   * notice. A durable work queue would not help: the crash that loses the timer

   * usually a `current_balance` delta, and for the one snapshot-only change that
   * moves no balance (a past-dated row shifted to another past month, so the
   * running total is unchanged) an explicit `AccountsService.touchAccount`.
   * Either way `accounts.updated_at` advances, so it is a timestamp the account
   * itself keeps -- and the snapshots are a delete-and-reinsert, so their
   * `updated_at` is when they were last computed. An account whose row is newer
   * than its own snapshots, and whose change is now older than the grace
   * period, was missed (see `STALE_SNAPSHOT_GRACE_MS` for why the grace is an
   * age of the change, not a distance from the old snapshot -- MZ-1242-R5).
   *
   * This is the idempotent-predicate mechanism from `docs/cron-jobs.md`: two
   * replicas racing the sweep recompute the same accounts from scratch, under the
   * per-account lock, and the loser's work is simply redundant. Accounts with no
   * snapshots at all are deliberately not swept -- there is nothing to compare
