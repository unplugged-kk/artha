/**
 * RLS smoke for the net-worth module's out-of-request entry point (task R3).
 *
 * This suite deliberately does NOT mock `withScopedDb`: the real implementation
 * runs (at the default RLS_MODE=off), so a missing ambient context or a stale
 * ambient EntityManager surfaces here instead of in production.
 *
 * Real timers on purpose. AsyncLocalStorage propagates into a `setTimeout`
 * callback because the timer is a real async resource; jest's fake timers
 * invoke the callback directly and would make the propagation assertion
 * vacuous. The debounce window is shortened instead of being waited out.
