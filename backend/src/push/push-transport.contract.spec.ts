/**
 * The set of push transports is written twice by necessity -- once as the
 * TypeScript constant the DTO validates against (`@IsIn(PUSH_TRANSPORTS)`), once
 * as the CHECK constraint the database enforces -- and a list that means
 * something is checked in both directions rather than trusted to stay aligned
 * (root CLAUDE.md, "a list of columns that means something is written once, in
 * the place that can check it").
 *
 * The failure this prevents is quiet: a transport added to the constant but not
 * the CHECK passes the DTO and dies in PostgreSQL as 23514, which
 * `isForeignEndpointConflict` does not classify, so the subscriber sees a
 * generic 500 and no log names the list that drifted. The other direction --
 * a value the CHECK admits that the DTO refuses -- is a row nothing can write,
 * which is a dead branch in the schema rather than a defect, but the same
 * drift.
 *
 * Migration 184 and schema.sql both declare the constraint under the same name;
 * schema.sql is the one read here because it is what a fresh install boots
 * from and what `scripts/verify-schema.sh` holds the migrations equal to.
