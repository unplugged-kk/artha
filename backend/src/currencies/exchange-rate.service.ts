   * skips a pair the moment it has *any* row -- so a user whose USD/CAD history
   * starts at their import has nothing at all for 2017, and a point-in-time
   * report asked about that year cannot present a USD account in CAD or value a
   * USD holding inside a CAD brokerage. Neither is a number to guess at: the
   * report reports the pair as missing and the total goes null, which is what
   * the user sees as "Total unavailable". The rates are simply not there yet,
   * so this fetches them.
   *
   * **The unit is a calendar month, not a day.** One provider call returns the
   * whole daily series for whatever period it is asked for and costs the same
   * either way, so asking for the month around `date` -- plus
   * `BOUNDARY_LAG_DAYS` of lead, which is the span `closeAt` may reach back
   * over, so the first days of the month are answerable too -- makes every
   * other date in that month a database read. A user stepping a report back
   * through a year pays twelve calls per pair rather than three hundred.
   *
   * Best-effort by construction: it is called from a read path, so a provider
   * failure is logged and the report renders with the pair still missing rather
   * than the request failing. Callers decide which pairs are missing; this does
   * not re-check the database, and it never invents a rate -- a pair the
   * provider has no data for stays absent.
