/**
 * Proves the two currency-reference functions consult every foreign key that
 * points at `currencies(code)`.
 *
 * That list has been wrong three times, in three places, for three reasons.
 * `CurrenciesService.isInUseGlobally` named only some of the referencing columns
 * -- `budgets.currency_code` and both `exchange_rates` columns were absent, so
 * it could call a live code dead and hand the caller a foreign-key violation.
 * The backup restore's cleanup named all of them but ran under the caller's RLS
 * scope, where the clauses looking for other users' rows could not see them, and
 * the `user_currency_preferences` cascade then deleted another user's
 * activation. And the backup export did not use the list at all: it selected
 * currencies by `created_by_user_id`, so a user whose accounts were denominated
 * in somebody else's custom currency exported the references without the
 * definition.
 *
 * All three now go through SQL functions -- `currency_code_in_use_globally`
 * (migration 136) for the global question, `currency_codes_referenced_by_user`
 * (migration 137) for the per-user one. What is left to go wrong is a migration
 * adding a reference and not extending them, so that is checked here against
 * the schema rather than against a list somebody has to remember to update.
