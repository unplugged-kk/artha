/**
 * Every column that holds a `currencies(code)` value.
 *
 * The two SQL functions (migrations 136 and 137) answer the *database's*
 * questions about this list. This is the same list for the one caller that
 * cannot ask the database: the support backup rewrites currency codes inside an
 * in-memory export, after the rows have left Postgres.
 *
 * It is a hand-written list, which is exactly the thing that has gone wrong here
 * three times -- so `currency-references.spec.ts` parses
 * `database/schema.sql` and fails when this and the schema disagree in either
 * direction. Add a currency reference in a migration and the test names it.
