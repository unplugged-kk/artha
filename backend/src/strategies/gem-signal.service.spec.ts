/**
 * Straight-line price series so momentum per role is predictable.
 *
 * It has to reach the newest period these specs evaluate. Since algorithm
 * version 2 a boundary close only counts within `BOUNDARY_LAG_DAYS` of the
 * boundary, so a series stopping short leaves the last periods unpriced and
 * unevaluated -- which reads as a bug in the service rather than in the
 * fixture. 42 months from January 2022 is 2025-07-28, three days before the
 * 2025-07-31 evaluation the specs' `asOf` of 2025-08-14 falls after.
 *
 * It also has to reach *past* that period: a span settles only once the series
 * holds a close dated at or after its far boundary, because "the market was
 * shut on the 31st" and "the 31st's close has not been fetched yet" look
 * identical from a series that stops before it. A live series always carries
 * that later close -- the quote job keeps running -- so the monthly-on-the-28th
 * fixture gets one appended rather than an exemption. It is a settled marker
 * only: every boundary these specs evaluate resolves to a close at or before
 * it, so no assertion reads its value.
