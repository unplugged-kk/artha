   * A holding's cost basis in the report currency, or null when it cannot be

   * Five ways it stays unknown, and each is a real state rather than a
   * shortcut:
   *
   * - a lot with no average cost at all, which the holdings query already
   *   reports (an imported position nobody costed);
   * - an account whose books are in a currency other than the report's. The
   *   per-transaction rate translated the purchase into the *account's*
   *   currency, so a further conversion to the report currency would have to
   *   pick a rate for an aggregate spanning years -- there is no such rate,
   *   and today's is the wrong answer this method exists to avoid;
   * - a derived basis of zero, which for a position that is held means the
   *   transactions do not describe how it was acquired, not that it was free;
   * - **a replay that does not reproduce the position being valued.** An
   *   imported portfolio often carries the holding without every trade behind
   *   it, and a basis for 50 shares beside a market value for 100 is not a
   *   smaller basis, it is a basis for a different position. Reported as a
   *   gain it is mostly the cost of the shares nobody recorded: 100 shares
   *   worth 1,500 against a replayed 500 for half of them shows 1,000 of gain
   *   and 190 of tax where the truth is 500 and 95;
   * - a replay the lot itself reports as unpriced (`basisKnown: false`),
   *   which is what an `ADD_SHARES` or `REMOVE_SHARES` leaves behind, and
   *   equally an acquisition stored with no price at all;
   * - **a basis denominated in something else.** The replay converts each
   *   trade into the account that paid for it, which is the funding account
   *   or the brokerage's linked cash account -- not the brokerage. A PLN
   *   brokerage funded from a EUR account holds a EUR basis, and setting that
   *   against a PLN market value reports the exchange rate as profit.
   *
   * The units and the money are two separate questions, and this asks both.
   * The quantity check proves the history accounts for the units; it says
   * nothing about what they cost, because a quantity-only row reconciles
   * perfectly and prices nothing. Buy 50 at 10, then `ADD_SHARES` 50, and the
   * holding is 100 units against a replayed cost of 500 -- pass that as the
   * basis and the report claims 500 of gain and 95 of tax that nobody made.
   * `REMOVE_SHARES` runs the same error the other way: buy 100 at 10, remove
   * 50, and the replayed 1,000 against a stored 500 turns a real gain into a
   * loss. `ReplayedLot.basisKnown` is where that is decided; the comment on
   * `calculateCostBasisLotsInAccountCurrency` explains why the application
   * cannot answer it.
   *
   * The comparison is **per account**, not on the sum. Summed first, a holding
   * 30 units above its history in one account and 30 below in another
   * reconciles exactly, and both wrong bases are reported as the position's
   * cost.
