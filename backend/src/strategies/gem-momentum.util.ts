 *   1. Absolute momentum -- compare the US equity leg's trailing return with
 *      the risk-free leg's (`RISK_FREE`, T-bills in the original rules).
 *      Equities win => RISK_ON, otherwise RISK_OFF and the portfolio moves into
 *      the `SAFE` instrument, which is a different asset: the yardstick and the
 *      thing you hold need not be the same fund.
 *   2. Relative momentum -- while RISK_ON, hold the equity market with the
 *      strongest trailing return. While RISK_OFF the ranking is not consulted.
 * The portfolio is always 100% in a single asset.
