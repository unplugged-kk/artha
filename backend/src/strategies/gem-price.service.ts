  /**
   * Close prices per security from `fromDate` onwards, oldest first, thinned to
   * the requested sampling. Weekly/monthly sampling keeps the last close of each
   * bucket (DISTINCT ON), which is what a period-end comparison wants.
   *
   * **Adjusted closes, and one basis per series.** Everything downstream of
   * this method measures a *return over time*: momentum, the performance chart,
   * the backtest. On raw closes a 4-for-1 split reads as a 75% crash, which
   * does not merely dent the chart -- it flips the absolute-momentum test and
   * hands the signal to the safe asset -- and every distribution is silently
   * dropped from the return of whichever instrument pays the most, which is
   * usually the bond leg the equities are being measured against.
   *
   * A per-row `COALESCE(adjusted_close, close_price)` looked like the same
   * thing and was not. `adjusted_close` is nullable *per row* and only the
   * provider backfill writes it; transaction-derived prices, the MNY import and
   * the demo seed all insert a raw close beside it. The coalesce therefore
   * spliced raw rows into an adjusted series for any instrument the user has
   * ever traded -- a security adjusted to 50 around a split, with a purchase
   * recorded at the unadjusted 205, produced a +310% trailing return that runs
   * the absolute-momentum test, and a -73% drawdown that never happened. That
   * is exactly what `docs/time-series-contract.md` rule 1 forbids: never mix
   * adjusted and raw prices for the same instrument inside one calculation.
   *
   * So the basis is decided per security, over the window being read: if any
   * row in it carries an adjusted close, the series is the adjusted rows only,
   * and the unadjusted rows are left out rather than converted. If none does,
   * the series is raw throughout -- consistent, and the only series available
   * for an instrument nobody has adjusted data for. Splits still distort a
   * wholly-raw series; that is a data gap to fill, not something a fallback per
   * row can paper over.
   *
   * Valuing today's holdings is the other case and stays on the raw close:
   * `latestPrices` answers "what is this position worth", where the adjusted
   * series is the wrong number.
   *
   * One query for every security: the report needs four series and issuing four
   * round trips per request buys nothing.
