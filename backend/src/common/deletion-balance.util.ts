 * How much an account's balance must move when this row is deleted.

 * A deletion reverses exactly what the row contributed, and a row contributes
 * nothing when it is `VOID` (excluded from `recalculateCurrentBalance` and from
 * every report) or future-dated (never folded into `currentBalance`). So the
 * answer for either is `0` -- reversing a VOID row creates the money the void
 * withheld.
 *
 * This exists as one function because the rule was written out at nine deletion
 * sites across four services and three of them omitted the status check. Two of
 * the three sat in the *same function* as a correct one: `removeParentTransaction`
 * guarded the deleted row and the split parent and not the sibling counterparts,
 * so deleting one leg under a VOID parent debited every other target account by
 * its own amount (recheck RR4-001). The import and investment cash-leg cleanups
 * had the same omission.
 *
 * Call it and act on the result rather than re-deriving the condition:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const { delta, needsRecalc } = deletionBalanceEffect(row);
 * if (delta !== 0) await this.accountsService.updateBalance(row.accountId, delta);
 * await m.remove(row);
 * if (needsRecalc) await this.accountsService.recalculateCurrentBalance(row.accountId);
 * ```
 *
 * `deletion-balance.guard.spec.ts` scans for a new hand-rolled reversal.
