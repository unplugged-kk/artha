/**
 * Loading a price series with **one basis per series**.
 *
 * `docs/time-series-contract.md` rule 1: a return, performance or backtest
 * calculation reads adjusted closes, and it must never mix adjusted and raw
 * prices for the same instrument. A per-row `COALESCE(adjusted_close,
 * close_price)` looks like "adjusted, falling back where the provider gave
 * none" and is in fact a splice -- `adjusted_close` is nullable per row and only
 * the provider backfill writes it, so transaction-derived prices, imports and
 * seeds all insert a raw close beside it. Around a split that is a
 * several-hundred-percent return and a drawdown that never happened.
 *
 * So the basis is decided once per series over the window being read: if any row
 * in it carries an adjusted close, the series is the adjusted rows only and the
 * unadjusted rows are left out rather than converted. If none does, the series
 * is raw throughout -- consistent, and the only series available for an
 * instrument nobody has adjusted data for.
 *
 * This lives under `common/` because two tables now hold the same shape: the
 * user-owned `security_prices` and the global `market_index_prices`. The GEM
 * report and the Security Performance comparison read through this one function,
 * so there is a single place the rule can be got right or wrong.

 * excluded from its own chart. A read with lead days in front of it never sees
 * this, which is why it stayed latent until a window opened exactly where the
 * data does.
