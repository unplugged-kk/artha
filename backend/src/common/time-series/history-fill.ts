 * A point-in-time report can only present a figure it can price and convert,
 * and for a date years back the database frequently holds neither: the daily
 * refreshes write today, and the one-off backfills stop at the first row they
 * find. So the report asks the provider for what it is missing, at read time.
 * Exchange rates and security prices do exactly the same thing for exactly the
 * same reason, which is why the policy lives here once rather than twice.

 *
 * A month rather than a day because one provider call returns the whole daily
 * series for whatever period it is asked for and costs the same either way.
 * Every other date in that month is then a database read -- a user stepping a
 * report back through a year pays twelve calls per series rather than three
