/**
 * `docs/time-series-contract.md` section 2.1: turning a stored observation into
 * a value-for-a-date must go through the shared helper that applies the
 * staleness window, and adding a second unbounded path beside the bounded one is
 * how the rule ends up with a constant, a docstring and three call sites that
 * ignore both. The contract asks for a scanning test "in the manner of
 * `frontend/src/test/ui-conventions.test.ts`", because the prose form of this
 * rule cannot see a new call site. This is it.
 *
 * What it looks for: a *newest-observation* read of a price or rate -- a date
 * ordered descending beside a one-row fetch (`findOne`, `take(1)`, `LIMIT 1`,
 * `DISTINCT ON`, `ROW_NUMBER() ... = 1`) -- with no lower bound on the date
 * nearby. Ordering a list by date descending is not that, and is not flagged.
 *
 * Matching is done over a window of lines around each ordering rather than over
 * the whole file: a file usually contains several queries, and a bounded one
 * elsewhere in it says nothing about this one. That imprecision is what the
 * first draft of this guard got wrong, and it hid two of the sites below.
 *
 * The baseline is **shrink-only**. Every entry is a site that predates the
 * guard, with the reason it is tolerated. A new one fails the build; fixing one
 * means deleting its line here in the same change.

 * revisited; recording them is what lets the guard be switched on today rather
 * than after a refactor nobody has scheduled. New code must not join the list --
 * `closeAt` in `price-boundary.util.ts` is the door.
