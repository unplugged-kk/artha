/**
 * The one door between a stored price observation and a value-for-a-date.
 *
 * `docs/time-series-contract.md` section 2.1 is explicit that a named window
 * constant is not enough on its own: turning an observation into "the price on
 * this date" has to go through a shared helper that applies the window, and
 * every site that needs such a value has to use it. This module is that helper.
 * It lives under `common/` rather than beside its first caller because the GEM
 * signal, the GEM chart and the Security Performance comparison all ask the same
 * question, and three copies of a staleness bound is three chances to widen one.
 *
 * `strategies/gem-momentum.util.ts` re-exports these names for the call sites
 * that already imported them from there. That is a second *name*, not a second
 * implementation -- which is the distinction the rule cares about.
