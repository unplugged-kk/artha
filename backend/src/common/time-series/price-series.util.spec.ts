/**
 * The per-series basis rule of `docs/time-series-contract.md` rule 1.
 *
 * A unit spec cannot execute the SQL, so the semantic half of the rule is
 * asserted against the statement the loader emits -- the per-row fallback must
 * not come back, and the per-series decision must be there -- while the row
 * mapping is asserted against driver-shaped fixtures. `has_adjusted` is a
 * boolean and the numerics come back as strings, which is what `pg` returns for
 * `NUMERIC`; a fixture using JavaScript numbers there would be a shape the
 * driver never produces (financial contract section 8.3).
