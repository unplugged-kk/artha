/**
 * The RLS exemption list is one list, and this is where that is checked.
 *
 * It used to be four, and they had already diverged:
 * `database/migrations/114_rls_policies_special.sql` documented four tables, the
 * exemption block at the foot of `database/schema.sql` documented six, and
 * `backend/test/integration/rls-enforcement.integration.spec.ts` and
 * `backend/test/integration/rls-enable.integration.spec.ts` each carried their
 * own six-entry array -- the second under a test named "leaves the four exempt
 * tables untouched". `database/CLAUDE.md` made five. The migration asserted that
 * "the catalog-driven test in T2 asserts this exact list" while the test
 * asserted a different one.
 *
 * Nothing caught any of it, because both integration specs need a live
 * PostgreSQL and neither runs in `npm run test:unit`. This spec needs no
 * database: it reads the schema's marker block and compares it with the
 * constant the specs now import, in **both** directions -- a table added to the
 * constant without the schema fails, and so does the reverse.
 *
 * Per `backend/CLAUDE.md`: a scan that names a file is disarmed silently when
 * that file moves or its marker is edited away, so a missing block **throws**
 * rather than comparing against an empty set.
