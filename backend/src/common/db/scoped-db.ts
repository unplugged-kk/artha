/**
 * The single sanctioned door to the database under Row-Level Security.
 *
 * `withScopedDb` opens a transaction, sets the identity GUC transaction-locally
 * (`set_config(..., true)`, i.e. `SET LOCAL` semantics) as its first statement,
 * and runs `fn` with the transaction's EntityManager. Because the GUC dies with
 * the transaction, no pooled connection can ever carry a prior request's
 * identity -- there is no reset code, no release hook. See the RLS design doc,
 * Phase 2b.
 *
 * It **throws** when no ambient context exists: a silent fallback to
 * `dataSource.manager` would run a query with no GUC under enforcement (zero
 * rows that look exactly like empty data). Refusing instead moves that whole
 * failure class to dev/CI at `RLS_MODE=off`, long before enforcement.
 *
 * The "scope" is whatever identity `withUserContext`/`withSystemContext` (or the
 * RequestContextInterceptor) put in the ambient context: those establish an
 * identity, this spends it on a database handle. Formerly named `tenantTx` --
 * older commits, the 1.13.0 release note and migration 107 still say that.

// The active transaction's EntityManager, carried in its own ALS scope so a
// nested withScopedDb can join the ambient transaction instead of opening a
// second one. A second `dataSource.transaction` would take a second pooled
// connection inside the first and deadlock the pool under load (design 2b).
//
// The identity that opened the transaction travels with it. The GUCs are set
// once, as the transaction's first statement, and are transaction-local -- so a
// nested call that joins under a *different* ambient identity gets the outer
// transaction's GUCs regardless of what its own context says. That silently
// disagrees with the application's belief about who it is acting as (DR-01):
// usually it fails closed or writes to the outer identity, but a caller that
// uses the nested identity for a non-database decision is then wrong, and a
// nested `withSystemContext` reads as an escape hatch that does not escape.
// Recording the identity here is what lets the join refuse instead.
