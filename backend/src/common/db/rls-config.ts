 * would allow is unrepresentable by construction (see the RLS design doc,
 * Phase 1/6):
 *   - `off`     : no identity GUCs emitted, runtime connects as the owner --
 *                 byte-for-byte identical to pre-RLS behavior.
 *   - `shadow`  : identity GUCs emitted per transaction, runtime still the owner
 *                 (policies bypassed) -- exercises the whole mechanism safely.
 *   - `enforce` : identity GUCs emitted and runtime connects as the
 *                 unprivileged `monize_app` role.
