/**
 * The serialization primitives every writer of derived financial state shares.
 *
 * Two protocols maintain derived state in this codebase and they are not
 * compatible with each other:
 *
 *   1. an atomic delta -- `current_balance = current_balance + $1`;
 *   2. an absolute recomputation -- read the ledger, write the total.
 *
 * (1) is safe against another (1): the `UPDATE` re-reads the row after it wins
 * the row lock, so two deltas compose. (1) is *not* safe against (2): under
 * `READ COMMITTED` the recomputation's `SELECT` and its `UPDATE` are separate
 * statement snapshots, so a delta that commits between them is silently
 * overwritten with a total that never saw it (audit P4-005).
 *
 * The fix is not to pick one protocol -- it is to make every writer take the
 * same lock before it reads the inputs it will write back:
 *
 *   - `lockAccountsForBalanceWrite` for `accounts.current_balance`. A real row
 *     lock, which is what makes (1) and (2) compose: an absolute writer holding
 *     it forces a concurrent delta to wait, and the delta's `+ $1` then applies
 *     to the total the recomputation just committed. Conversely a recomputation
 *     that arrives second blocks on the row, and its ledger `SELECT` -- issued
 *     after the lock, so on a fresh snapshot -- sees the delta's ledger row.
 *
 *   - `lockHoldingScope` for `holdings`. A holding cannot always be row-locked
 *     (the row may not exist yet) and a rebuild must serialize against
 *     *investment_transactions inserts*, not just against holding rows, so the
 *     lock is an advisory one keyed by account.
 *
 *   - `lockTokenFamily` for a refresh-token family, whose members are inserted
 *     concurrently with the revocation that has to cover them (P4-011).
 *
 * Ordering rule, to keep these deadlock-free: **advisory locks are always taken
 * before row locks**, and a set of ids is always locked in ascending order.
 * `lockHoldingScope` and `lockAccountsForBalanceWrite` both sort; a caller that
 * needs both takes the advisory one first.
 *
 * **For `transactions` rows there is one more rule, and it is by role rather than
 * by id: a split parent is locked before any of its legs.** Ascending-id order
 * cannot be the whole answer here, because a caller cannot know a leg id until it
 * has read the split -- `removeSplit` necessarily locks the parent and only then
 * the leg. A batch that sorted parent and leg together would take them in the
 * opposite order whenever the leg's UUID sorts first, and two requests in
 * opposite orders is a `40P01` for both (audit RV4-005). With the parent always
 * first it becomes the serialization point: any two paths touching the same
 * parent's legs have already queued behind it, so their order among the legs
 * cannot matter. Legs are still batched ascending, which covers the paths that
 * lock several with no parent involved -- the two legs of an ordinary transfer,
 * including the cross-owner pair, where each side names its own leg and so must
 * sort rather than start from the one it was given.
 *
 * Every helper takes an `EntityManager` and must be called inside a
 * `withScopedDb` callback -- `pg_advisory_xact_lock` and `FOR UPDATE` are both
 * released by the enclosing transaction, which is the point: there is no
 * unlock to forget.
