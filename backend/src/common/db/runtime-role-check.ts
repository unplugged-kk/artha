 * every policy on it. An operator who points `DATABASE_APP_USER` at the database
 * owner, or at a pre-existing role that happens to hold `BYPASSRLS`, gets a
 * successful boot, a log line saying enforce, and no database-level tenant

 * role that already exists is only altered, the deployment may provision the
 * role declaratively (CNPG `managed.roles`) where the application never touches
 * it, and an attribute granted after startup is invisible either way.
 *
 * So the runtime asks the database, over the connection it will actually serve
 * requests on, what it is -- and refuses to start when the answer is not the
 * unprivileged role the mode promises. Fail closed: a wrong answer here means
 * every later query silently sees every tenant.
