/**
 * The SQL functions the application calls, declared once, with the migration
 * that creates each.
 *
 * A migration is the only thing that puts these in a database, and the migration
 * runner is a **separate process** from the server (`db-migrate.js`, then
 * `main.js` -- see `docker-entrypoint.sh`). So there is a real state where the
 * code that calls a function is running and the function is not there: a dev
 * container whose watcher rebuilt the source without restarting the container, a
 * deployment whose migration step was skipped or ran against a different
 * database, a restored volume older than the image on top of it.
 *
 * What that looked like before this file existed: a backup restore got as far as
 * `deleteAllUserData`, called `currency_code_in_use_globally` (migration 136),
 * and came back as
 *
 *     QueryFailedError: function currency_code_in_use_globally(character varying)
 *     does not exist
 *
 * behind a generic 500. The transaction rolled back, so nothing was lost -- but
 * the message names neither the cause nor the fix, and the same database would
 * have failed the same way on the next currency delete and the next export. A
 * schema the running code cannot use is not a per-request error; it is a
 * deployment that should never have started serving.
 *
 * Hence: one list, checked at boot, and the server refuses rather than
 * discovering it mid-write. This is the same posture as `runtime-role-check.ts`
 * -- ask the database what it actually is, and fail closed on a wrong answer.
 *
 * `required-db-functions.spec.ts` keeps the list honest in both directions: every
 * entry must be created by `database/schema.sql` **and** by the migration it
 * names, and every function `database/schema.sql` defines that `src/` mentions
 * must appear here. That second direction is the one that matters -- it means a
 * new SQL function called from TypeScript cannot be added without registering
 * it, which is precisely the omission that produced the failure above.
