 *
 * `withUserContext` cannot express this. It seeds one id into both GUCs, which
 * collapses a delegate request onto a single identity -- and the three special
 * policies M2 wrote for delegation (`users`, `account_delegates`,
 * `delegate_account_favourites`, plus the authenticated-user arm on
 * `user_preferences` / `trusted_devices` / `refresh_tokens`) each need the two
 * ids to differ. Seeding only the delegate hides the owner's rows; seeding only
 * the owner hides the delegate's own. Both failures return zero rows rather than
 * raising, inside ordinary request scope where nothing logs -- which is exactly
 * why this has its own helper instead of a second `withUserContext` call.
 *
 * Callers are the two places that hold both ids before the request scope exists:
 * `jwt.strategy`'s acting-context re-validation and `AccountDelegateGuard`.

 * own identity, no system bypass, and it works in every RLS mode -- the GUC
 * emission is deliberately not mode-gated (see scoped-db.ts).
