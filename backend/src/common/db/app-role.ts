 * an owner for the RLS check and bypasses every policy without ever issuing
 * `SET ROLE`. `NOINHERIT` makes that the role's default, which helps.
 *
 * It cannot be the whole answer, for three reasons that all apply here: the
 * deployment may provision the role declaratively (CNPG `managed.roles`) where
 * this SQL never runs; PostgreSQL 16 stores inheritance on each membership grant,
 * so `GRANT owner TO app WITH INHERIT TRUE` overrides the role default; and the
