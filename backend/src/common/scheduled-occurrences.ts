 *
 *  - **An override can move an occurrence INTO the window from beyond it.** The
 *    walk therefore runs past `through` as far as the furthest recurrence slot
 *    whose override lands inside, instead of stopping at `through` and losing it.
 *  - **An override can move an occurrence OUT of the window.** Filtering is on
 *    the date the occurrence actually falls on, never on the recurrence slot.
 *
 * `maxOccurrences` is applied after ordering by `dueDate`, so "the next
 * occurrence" is the next one to actually happen -- not the earliest recurrence
 * slot, which a backward move can push behind a later one.
