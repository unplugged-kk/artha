 * and again in `ScheduledTransactionsService.getLlmUpcomingBillsAndDeposits`,
 * comments and all -- and the next change to it (whether a same-currency
 * component still rounds, whether a rejected provider fetch withholds or throws)
 * would have had to be made in both, with only one of them reasoned about.
 *
 * Two causes of an incomplete total, kept apart because they send the reader to
 * different repairs:
 *
 *   * an `amount` of `null` -- the value could not be worked out at all, so it is
 *     unknown in every currency and there is no pair to blame. Counted, never
 *     named: reporting "no rate for CAD->USD" would send the reader to add a rate
 *     that is very likely already there.
 *   * a currency with no rate into `into` -- named in `missingPairs`, because
 *     that one IS a rate the reader can add.
 *
 * `sign` maps each amount into the bucket's own convention (bills are reported as
 * positive magnitudes). It is applied BEFORE conversion, which is equivalent for
 * a positive rate and keeps the rounding at one scale.
