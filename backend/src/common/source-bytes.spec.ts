/**
 * A raw control byte in a source file makes every text tool treat that file as
 * binary. `grep` prints "binary file matches" and no line, `file` reports
 * "data", `git diff` shows "Binary files differ", and a source-scanning guard
 * test that reads the file as UTF-8 gets a string it can still match -- but a
 * human reviewing the diff, or grepping for the pattern, sees nothing.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. `support-backup-integrity.ts` carried a literal NUL
 * as the separator joining unique-key group columns. The choice of a NUL was
 * correct (a printable separator would fold ("a", "b") and ("a b", "") into one
 * group and suffix a name that never collided); writing it as the byte rather
 * than as a `\u0000` escape was not, and it hid the whole file from review for as long
 * as it was there.
 *
 * The rule is therefore mechanical: express a control character as an escape.
 * Tab, LF and CR are exempt -- they are ordinary whitespace in source.
