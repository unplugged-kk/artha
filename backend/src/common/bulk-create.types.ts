 * Every bulk path already computes a per-row reason and used to discard it,
 * answering "none of the edits could be prepared -- check each transactionId"
 * instead. That sentence is a guess, and on the failure that prompted this it
 * was the wrong one: seventeen rows were refused because a split transaction's
 * categories live on its split lines and the edit resent none, and the reason
 * said exactly that, in words the model could have acted on. Told to check the
 * ids -- which were correct -- it concluded the task was impossible and gave
 * up.
 *
 * So the reasons travel. Identical reasons collapse into one line with a count
 * (a batch usually fails the same way in every row), and distinct ones are
 * listed up to {@link MAX_REPORTED_REASONS} with a tail count, so a 25-row
 * batch cannot flood the context.
 *
 * Returns "" for an empty list, so callers can append it unconditionally.
