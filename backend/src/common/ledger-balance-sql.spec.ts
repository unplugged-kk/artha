 * The as-of ledger balance means one thing, so it is spelled once.

 * Four services wrote the same join out by hand and the copies had already
 * drifted. The scheduled loan bill (INV-LOAN-006) claims the debt it prices is
 * the same measurement the balances-as-of report shows, which holds only while
 * the predicates agree -- so a fifth hand-written copy is a defect, not a
 * style preference.
 *
 * The scan reads code, not prose: comments are blanked first (line numbers
 * preserved), or the paragraph above explaining the banned pattern would fail
 * the guard that bans it.

 *
 * Reports are deliberately NOT in scope. A report asking which rows to count
 * is asking a different question with a different answer -- several read split
 * *children* on purpose, because a parent's amount is not the cash meaning of
 * its lines (root CLAUDE.md, "A report that reads only the parent row cannot
 * exclude a line, so it excludes an amount"). That family has its own single
