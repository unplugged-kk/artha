/**
 * The one durable claim mechanism for work that must happen at most once per
 * user, however many backend replicas fire the same cron.
 *
 * The multi-replica jobs in this codebase need three things, and they used to
 * invent a different ad hoc guard for each (audit DR-04-04):
 *
 * - `claimLease` -- an **exclusion**. Only one replica may do this now. Expires,
 *   so a replica killed mid-run does not lock the user out until someone notices;
 *   `releaseLease` returns it early. Returns a **lease token** identifying the
 *   winning attempt, which `markDelivered` and `releaseLease` require: the unique key names the
 *   work, not the holder, so without the token a worker delayed past its own expiry
 *   could delete a lease another replica had retaken, or record a delivery for a
 *   send that replica had not finished (audit DR-RRV4-01).
 *
 * - `markDelivered` / `wasDelivered` -- the **delivery record**. Written after the
 *   side effect succeeded, re-read under the lease to decide whether the work is
 *   still owed. A delivered row is never retaken.
 *
 * - `claimOnce` -- a permanent claim, for work where the claim row itself *is* the
 *   fact and nothing leaves the database: a posted occurrence, an alert
 *   fingerprint. `releasePermanentClaim` hands it back on failure.
 *
 * **A claim is not a record that the work was done**, and reaching for `claimOnce`
 * as though it were is how a delivery gets lost: the claim commits, the process
 * dies, and the permanent row now says a send happened that never did (audit
 * FV4-004, FV4-005, RV4-006). So anything with a crash window between claiming and
 * sending takes the lease *and* keeps a delivery record -- either on this table via
 * `markDelivered`, as the bill and mortgage reminders do, or in a column of its own
 * where the domain already has one (`emergency_access_settings
 * .last_reminder_sent_at`, `emergency_access_contacts.claim_notified_at`).
 *
 * That makes those jobs **at-least-once**: a process killed after the provider
 * accepted but before the record committed re-sends next run. For a reminder that
 * is the right trade, and it is a decision rather than an oversight -- see
 * `docs/cron-jobs.md`, which states the contract per job.
 *
 * Both are a single statement, so the claim is the serialization point: there is
 * no window between deciding and recording. Every call must sit inside an
 * ambient identity context (`withUserContext` / `withSystemContext`) like any
 * other database access.
