/**
 * Exclusion between the operations that replace a user's whole dataset and
 * anything that would read or derive from it while they run (audit DR-04-02).
 *
 * Three operations rewrite everything a user owns: a backup restore, the
 * self-service "delete my data", and a `.mny` import started with
 * `wipeExistingData`. Each is internally consistent -- restore and delete are
 * one transaction apiece, so a concurrent reader sees the before or the after and
 * never a half -- but they are not consistent with *each other*, and the `.mny`
 * import is not one transaction at all: its wipe commits and the rows then
 * arrive over the following minutes, so for the length of the import the user's
 * dataset is legitimately empty.
 *
 * That window is where the damage is. The hourly auto-backup fired into it would
 * export the empty dataset, write it as today's file, and then enforce retention
 * -- rotating the last good backup out to make room for a file containing
 * nothing. Nothing in the system flags that, and it is not recoverable.
 *
 * So: a lease the destructive operations hold, and an `isUnderMaintenance` read
 * everything derived consults. An active `import_jobs` row counts as
 * maintenance without a lease of its own -- the row already *is* the fact, and
 * inventing a second parallel truth for it is how the two drift.
