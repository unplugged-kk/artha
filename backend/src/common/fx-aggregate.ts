 * accumulator that *cannot* silently absorb a missing rate removes the place
 * that mistake can live.
 *
 * Read `docs/specs/fx-conversion-completeness.md` for the invariants and the
 * numerical examples, and `docs/financial-calculation-contract.md` section 1 for
 * the total/subtotal rule this implements.
