/**
 * A doc that names a file is making a claim about the source tree.
 *
 * The rule is already written down in the root `CLAUDE.md` -- rename or delete a
 * file and grep `docs/` and every `CLAUDE.md` in the same commit -- and it was
 * still broken: the cross-owner-transfers plan pointed into
 * `backend/src/ai/query/` for a service that lives at
 * `backend/src/transactions/transaction-tool-prep.service.ts`, so anyone
 * following the path would find nothing and either hunt for it or create a
 * second one. A rule in prose gets read, agreed with, and violated anyway; this
 * is the version the machine checks.
 *
 * The claim grammar (rooted / relative / bare, cross-tree exemptions, line
 * references) lives in `repo-paths.util.ts`, shared with the source-comment
 * guard (`source-comment-paths.spec.ts`) so it is written once. This file owns
 * the *doc* policy on top of it:
 *
 *  - In `docs/future-plans/` a path may name a file that does not exist yet --
 *    that is what a plan is for -- so non-existence alone proves nothing there.
 *    What a plan must not do is name a file that exists *somewhere else*: an
 *    unresolved path whose basename lives at another location is not a planned
 *    file, it is a stale reference to a moved or renamed one (`planProblem`).
 *    The blind spot is deliberate and named: a plan referencing a file that was
 *    *deleted* outright cannot be told from a planned one.
 *  - `docs/release-notes/` and `docs/audits/` are shipped historical records --
 *    editing them to match a later tree would falsify them -- so they are out of
 *    scope. Fenced code blocks are stripped before scanning (`docSpans`): they
 *    are sample code, where a hypothetical path is legitimate; the claim idiom
 *    is the inline span.
 *
 * The same grammar decides the inverse case: a doc asserting that a file is
 * *absent* -- `docs/release-integrity.md`'s gap register says the repository has
 * no branch-protection policy in it -- names it in plain prose rather than in a
 * span, because a span here means "this is here" and that doc is arguing the
 * opposite. Re-backticking such a name fails this suite, which is the intended
 * outcome: the day the file lands, the span is correct again.
 *
 * The inventory comes from `git ls-files`, so the guard sees exactly the tree
 * CI sees and needs no hand-maintained skip list: `node_modules`, build output
 * and local agent scratch are simply not tracked. Docs are collected from the
 * tracked list too, so an untracked draft never gates anything. Existence
 * checks include untracked-but-not-ignored files, so a doc committed alongside
 * a file it names does not fail locally before the file is staged.
