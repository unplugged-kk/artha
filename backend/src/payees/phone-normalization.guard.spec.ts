 * `manage_payees` tools through the same service, and the AI contact lookup,

 * with no DTO anywhere in its path. Each stored a different shape of the same
 * number, so nothing could compare two of them and a `tel:` link dialled
 * whatever the last writer happened to save.
 *
 * The rule is not that every file calls the normalizer: it is that a file
 * writing this column is one of the doors that does. A fourth writer added
 * later -- an importer, a merge, a bulk edit -- fails here rather than shipping
 * a second format nobody notices until two screens disagree.
