 * The operator's own Google Places key, and the cap that applies to it.

 * This is the deployment's resource, so it is configured the way every other
 * deployment resource is -- environment variables, editable nowhere in the UI
 * -- and it follows the rule in `backend/CLAUDE.md`: an environment variable
 * configures the deployment's own resource, never somebody else's. Where the
 * operator has set a key, every user's lookups spend it and the operator's cap
 * is the only one that applies; a user's own key and cap live on
 * `payee_lookup_settings` and are never sized from here.
 *
 * Declared as one table of `{ envVar, default, description }` so the set
 * cannot grow a knob with no name, default or documentation --
 * `google-places.config.spec.ts` checks it against `.env.example` in both
 * directions.
