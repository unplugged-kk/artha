 * Opens a decrypted `.mny` file with `mdb-reader` and exposes it through a

 *
 * Money's table and column set changed across releases -- Money 2001 has no
 * `BILL` table at all, which is what crash-looped the PR #192 proof of concept.
 * Nothing above this layer may call `getTable` directly: reads go through
 * `getTableOrNull` and `MnyTable.rows`, which silently drops columns the file
 * does not have instead of throwing.
 *
 * `mdb-reader` is ESM-only. TypeScript's `nodenext` module resolution emits a
 * `require()` for it, which Node 22 resolves natively, and Jest transforms it
 * to CommonJS via the `transformIgnorePatterns` allowlist the repo already
 * uses for `openid-client` and friends. That is why the reader is a plain
 * dependency here rather than the vendored copy the design document proposed.
