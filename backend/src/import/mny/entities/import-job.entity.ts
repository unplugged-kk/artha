/**
 * One background import attempt (design ADR-3).
 *
 * The row is the coordination point: `POST /import/mny/start` inserts it
 * `pending`, exactly one worker claims it by moving it to `running`, the running
 * job writes `progress` and `heartbeat_at` in their own short transactions so a
 * poller can see them, and a job whose heartbeat went stale is failed by the
 * next request that reads or competes for the slot -- with an hourly cron as the
 * backstop for a user who never asks again.
 * A failed job keeps `stagedFileId`, so Retry is a new job over the same bytes.
 *
 * The partial unique index is what makes "one import at a time per user" true:
 * two concurrent starts would otherwise both count zero active jobs and both
 * insert, importing the same staged bytes twice. Declared here as well as in
 * migration 135 because test and dev databases are synchronized from the
 * entities -- a guard that exists only in SQL cannot be tested.
