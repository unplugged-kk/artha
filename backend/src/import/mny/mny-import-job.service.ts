/**
 * Lifecycle of a background `.mny` import (design ADR-3).
 *
 * No queue, no Redis, no second process: `POST /import/mny/start` inserts a
 * `pending` row, exactly one worker claims it with a conditional UPDATE, and the
 * body runs as an unawaited in-process task under `withUserContext`. The wizard
 * polls the row.
 *
 * Four things make that safe on Kubernetes, where every replica runs the same
 * code, and it takes all four -- the first two were once described as sufficient
 * and were not:
 *
 * 1. **The insert is guarded by a partial unique index**, so two *requests*
 *    racing to start an import produce one job.
 * 2. **The claim is atomic**, so two pods racing over that one job produce one
 *    winner.
 * 3. **A running job heartbeats**, so a job whose pod died is reaped into
 *    `failed` instead of appearing to run forever -- retryable only when
 *    `data_committed` says nothing was written.
 * 4. **The claim mints an `attempt_token` and every worker write requires it.**
 *    Reaping alone decides that a worker is dead; it does not *stop* it. The
 *    heartbeat runs on its own connection while the import transaction runs on
 *    another, so a worker can be blocked past the stale threshold, be written
 *    off, and then wake up. Its commit checkpoint is a fenced compare-and-set on
 *    the token, and a zero-row result throws -- rolling the import back rather
 *    than committing the whole file behind the reaper's back, beside a job row
 *    inviting a retry that would import it again (audit RV4-001).
 *
 * Reaping is demand-driven. A stale row is not a tidiness problem -- the partial
 * unique index makes it refuse every future import that user starts, and
 * `discard` cannot touch it once it reached `running` -- so the two requests that
 * care clear it in their own transaction before deciding: `create`, which is
 * about to be refused by it, and `findOne`, which the wizard polls and which
 * would otherwise keep rendering a progress bar for a worker that is gone.
 * `reapStaleJobs` remains as an hourly cross-user backstop for the user who
 * closed the tab and never asked again.

 *
 * The `AND` binds tighter than the condition's `OR`, so the parenthesis around
 * it is the whole difference between "this user's stale jobs" and "this user's
 * jobs, plus everybody's stale pending ones". `reapStatement` is exported so a
 * test can assert that grouping rather than trusting the reader to see it.
 *
 * `retryable`, `error_key` and `error_detail` all branch on `data_committed`,

 * ledger it does not, and offering Retry there imports the file a second time.
 * The committed case gets its own key because the copy has to say something
 * different -- see `JOB_COMMITTED_STALLED_ERROR_KEY`.
 *
 * `attempt_token = NULL` is the revocation half, and it is what makes the
 * decision stick rather than merely record it. Reaping decides a worker is
 * dead; it cannot stop one that is only blocked. The worker's commit checkpoint
 * names its token, so clearing it here makes that worker's import transaction
 * refuse and roll back instead of landing behind the reaper's back
 * (audit RV4-001). Both call sites revoke, because the per-user reap runs on
 * the request path and is the one most likely to race a live worker.
