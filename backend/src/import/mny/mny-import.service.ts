/**
 * Runs a `.mny` import: staged bytes in, Monize rows and a verification report
 * out.
 *
 * The whole **write** is one transaction, so a failure *before it commits*
 * leaves nothing behind. What that transaction does not cover is everything
 * after it: post-processing, verification, staged-byte removal and the terminal
 * status write. A failure there leaves every imported row in place, and the row
 * used to advertise itself as retryable anyway -- so Retry inserted the file a
 * second time under fresh UUIDs, because the mapper generates new ids on every
 * parse and nothing on an imported row identifies its source record (audit
 * P4-002). `writeAll` therefore sets `import_jobs.data_committed` inside its own
 * transaction, and `MnyImportJobService.fail` will not call such a run
 * retryable.
 *
 * Progress still reaches the wizard mid-flight because the job service publishes
 * it on its own connection -- see `runOutsideActiveScopedManager`.
 *
 * The optional "start fresh" wipe happens in `start`, outside the job body, for
 * a security reason as much as an ordering one: `UsersService.deleteData`
 * re-authenticates, and its credentials must never be written into
 * `import_jobs.options`. It runs *after* the job row is inserted, though: the
 * row is this user's import lock, and a destructive operation performed before
 * the lock is held is one two concurrent requests can both perform. A wipe that
 * fails takes the row back out with it.
