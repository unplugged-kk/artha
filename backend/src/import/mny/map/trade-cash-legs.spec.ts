/**
 * Issue #1175: what the cash register of a brokerage account ends up holding.
 *
 * Money keeps an investment account's cash in a companion account and records
 * the cash half of a trade there as an ordinary `TRN` row paired to the trade
 * through `TRN_XFER`. Monize writes that row itself, from the investment
 * transaction, so importing Money's copy as well produced three rows where
 * Money shows one: the purchase, plus a transfer in and a transfer out that
 * cancelled each other.
 *
 * The cancellation is why no balance check caught it, and it is also what makes
 * the fix safe -- so these tests assert the row count **and** the balance
 * together. Either one alone was satisfied by the defect.
 *
 * The two mappers are exercised together on purpose: neither can see this on
 * its own, because the duplication is one mapper writing what the other already
 * wrote.
