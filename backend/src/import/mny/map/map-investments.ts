/**
 * `TRN` rows carrying a security, mapped onto Monize investment transactions.
 *
 * Every rule here answers a specific way PR #192 corrupted positions (issue 4 in
 * the design's assessment table):
 *
 * - **Driven from `TRN`, not `TRN_INV`.** A cash dividend (`act` 4) has no
 *   `TRN_INV` row at all, so iterating the detail table dropped every one of
 *   them. Investment rows are identified by carrying a security, never by their
 *   action code -- `act = 0` is BUY and is indistinguishable from a plain
 *   payment by code alone.
 * - **`act` 16 is REMOVE_SHARES, never SELL.** It closes lots without a sale, so
 *   mapping it to SELL both invented proceeds and corrupted average cost.
 * - **Quantity is always positive.** `TRN_INV.qty` is stored positive and
 *   direction comes only from the action; inferring it from a sign is what
 *   produced negative positions.
 * - **`SEC_SPLIT` is *not* applied to positions.** See `reportUnappliedSplits`:
 *   Money does not adjust its own share counts for those rows, and adjusting
 *   ours makes the import disagree with the file it came from.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the database, and no code is guessed: an action outside
 * the known set is skipped and counted, and an action whose meaning is inferred
 * or reported rather than measured here (`MNY_UNCONFIRMED_ACTIONS`) carries a
 * warning on every row it maps.

/**

 * premise that ignoring a split leaves every later position wrong by its ratio.
 * **Money does not adjust its own share counts for these rows**, so applying them
 * makes the import disagree with the file. Two files say so, at seven positions,
 * with no counter-example:
 *
 * - The maintainer's brokerage held 200 VTI bought pre-`SEC_SPLIT` plus 100
 *   after, and transferred the account away with a single 300-share row. Money's
 *   `LOT` rows for both purchases are fully consumed by that transfer; applying
 *   the 1:2 ratio leaves 200 shares in an account Money shows as empty. XIU
 *   (1:4), XIC (1:4) and VWO (1:2) each do the same thing.
 * - Money Plus's own `sample.mny` agrees: `LOT` holds 3 MSFT against 6 replayed
 *   with the 1:2 split, 50 LEH against 1,225, and 110.25 ADM against 115.7625.
 *
 * The price series makes the reason visible. A split's `SP` row carries
 * `dPrice = 0` and `src = 0` -- a marker in the quote history, not a quote -- and
 * the prices either side of it are continuous, in the same units as the
 * transactions. `SEC_SPLIT` is quote-feed metadata: it turns up for securities
 * the user never held, and for the annual 1:1 "splits" Canadian ETFs record
 * against a reinvested distribution.
 *
 * So the rows are surfaced rather than acted on, and only when they could have
 * mattered: a ratio of exactly 1 changes no position, and a security the import
 * left behind has no position to change.
