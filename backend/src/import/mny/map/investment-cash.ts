/**
 * Where a trade's cash row comes from, decided once for every surface that

 *
 * Monize records the cash half of an investment action in one of three places,
 * and only the first is a row the investment writer creates:
 *
 * 1. **The brokerage's cash sleeve.** `writeInvestments` inserts it and links it
 *    through `investment_transactions.transaction_id`.
 * 2. **A funding account Money already has a row in** (issue #1212). That row is
 *    the cash leg; the trade adopts it.
 * 3. **A split leg the trade is embedded in** (issue #1211). The leg carries the
 *    amount; there is no separate cash row at all.
 *
 * Three readers have to agree about which of the three a trade is in -- the
 * writer, the expected-balance computation and the per-account row count -- and
 * the failure mode when they disagree is silent: a balance short or long by the
 * trade, or a verification report that flags every brokerage cash account.
 * Hence one predicate rather than three copies of `cashAmount !== 0`.

 * their ratio is the rate that settlement actually happened at. Writing 1 there

 * FX spread. `cashAmount !== 0` is what puts a trade in this map at all, and
 * `cashAmountOf` returns 0 whenever `totalAmount` is 0, so the divisor is
 * always positive here.

 * row's amount carries it, so dividing by proceeds alone would inflate the rate
