/**
 * `TRN`, `TRN_SPLIT` and `TRN_XFER` mapped onto Monize transactions.
 *
 * The two rules that carry the most history:
 *
 * **The phantom filter is `frq != -1` and nothing else.** PR #192 also excluded
 * rows it read as auto-entered, but Money's scheduler posts real transactions --
 * including every loan payment -- so that filter is what made loan and mortgage
 * accounts import with zero transactions. Its sibling mistake outlived it:
 * `grftt & 0x80` was read as "voided" when it actually marks a row in a debt
 * account, so the loan payments that survived the filter all imported VOID and
 * dropped straight back out of the balance (see `MNY_TRANSACTION_FLAG`).
 *
 * **A split leg that is really a transfer stays a transfer.** PR #192 imported
 * every `TRN_SPLIT` child as a category-only row, so the principal leg of a loan
 * payment lost its transfer nature and showed blank. Here a child that appears
 * in `TRN_XFER` becomes a Monize transfer split pointing at the counterpart
 * transaction, which is imported exactly once as an ordinary row in the loan
 * account and links back to the *parent* payment -- the same wiring
 * `TransactionSplitService` produces for a hand-entered transfer split.

 * each -- the whole point of this function is that they are one question asked
 * once rather than three predicates that can disagree:
 *
 * **The trade's own sleeve (issue #1175).** Money keeps an investment account's
 * cash in a companion account and writes the cash side there -- `act` 1 does it
 * 2,015 times in 2,029, `act` 3 1,090 in 1,090. Monize writes that row itself
 * from the trade's `cashAmount`, linked through
 * `investment_transactions.transaction_id`, so importing Money's copy as well
 * put the same payment in the register three times: the purchase, a transfer in
 * and a transfer out. The row is dropped and the trade writes it instead. That
 * cannot move a balance, because the row and the counterpart
 * `buildCashCounterparts` used to synthesize for it always summed to zero.
 *
 * **A funding row in another account (issue #1212).** A purchase paid for out of
 * a chequing account. The row stays where Money put it and becomes the trade's
 * cash leg, with the trade recording it as its `funding_account_id` -- which is
 * what a natively entered trade funded from elsewhere already stores. Making it
 * a transfer into the sleeve instead left the sleeve holding a transfer in and
 * the trade's own leg taking it straight out again.
 *
 * **A leg of a split (issue #1211).** A paycheque with an investment purchase in
 * it. The leg becomes a `SplitKind.INVESTMENT` split with the trade embedded in
 * it through `transaction_split_id`, exactly as `createEmbeddedForSplit` writes
 * a hand-entered one; the leg's amount is the cash impact, so no cash row is
 * written anywhere. The old transfer-split shape put two more rows in the
 * sleeve, and showed the purchase as a transfer to an account the user never
 * chose.
 *
 * A pairing only qualifies when the far side is a trade **this import writes**
 * with a cash side of its own. A trade the investment mapper skipped, or one
 * that moves no cash, leaves Money's row alone: dropping it would lose the money
 * it records, and embedding a trade that does not exist would wire a split to
 * nothing.

 * The investment mapper takes that row and writes the trade, including its cash
 * leg *out* of the sleeve -- so nothing was left to represent the cash coming
 * *in*, and the bank row, whose partner is not a banking transaction, imported
 * as an ordinary payment with no counterpart.
 *
 * Money then simply vanished: across the maintainer's file 2,718 top-level rows
 * and 537 split legs debited a bank account with nothing arriving anywhere, and
 * the sleeves absorbed the whole difference -- $604,161.81 negative in total,
 * of which $553,225.57 is this.
 *
 * So the missing side is synthesized here, in the sleeve, linked to the bank
 * row both ways. The sleeve then nets out: the transfer pays cash in, the
 * trade's own leg takes it out.
 *
 * A near side already *in* that sleeve needs none of this, and gets none: those
 * rows are `tradeCashLegs`, so `isImportablePosting` rejects them and `nearId`
 * is undefined before the far side is ever looked at. A synthesized row
 * mirroring its own account is what issue #1175 saw in the register.
 *
 * Neither does a near side that is the trade's *own* cash movement --
 * `externalFunders` and `investmentSplitLegs`. Those rows already record the
 * money, so standing in for them a second time is what issues #1212 and #1211
 * saw. What is left for this function is the pairing that genuinely has no
 * banking counterpart: a far row carrying a security whose trade this import
 * does not write, or writes with no cash side.
