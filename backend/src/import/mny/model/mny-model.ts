 * `1Debit` and `0           2` in the register, which is what this exists to

 *
 * - `1` prefixes free text -- `Debit`, `ATM`, `Telebank`, `PC Banking`,
 *   `EComm`. 2,209 rows in the maintainer's file, not one of them numeric.
 * - `0` prefixes a number right-aligned in twelve characters. 1,060 rows, every
 *   one numeric, every one exactly thirteen characters long.
 *
 * **A `0` number in a loan or mortgage account is Money's payment number, and
 * Money does show it.** It was dropped here for four phases on the opposite
 * reading -- that it is an instalment counter Money's own register has no
 * column for -- which left the Ref. num. field empty on every row of every loan
 * and mortgage account (issue #1174, reported by a user looking at the column
 * it is displayed in). Money's loan register calls it **Pmt Num**; the
 * measurements behind the old reading were all correct and only the conclusion
 * was wrong. 657 of the 1,060 numbers do sit in debt accounts counting 1, 2, 3
 * up the payment schedule, all 461 in Money Plus's own `sample.mny` are the
 * "Home Loan" payment numbers, and the bank side of the transfer carries none
 * of them in any of 642 cases -- which is what a per-loan payment counter looks
 * like, and is exactly the value the user asked to see.
 *
 * So the account a row sits in no longer changes what `szId` decodes to: the
 * same shape is a cheque number outside a debt account and a payment number
 * inside one, and both belong in Ref. num. That is why this takes no `flags`
 * argument -- there is no branch left for one to feed.
 *
 * **Both shapes are matched strictly, and anything else is returned as-is.**
 * A bare `1042` is a cheque number a user typed, not the text `042` behind a
 * kind digit, so the text kind requires a non-digit after the `1` -- which
 * costs nothing, since not one of the 2,209 text references in the file is
 * numeric -- and the number kind requires the padding Money writes. Losing a
