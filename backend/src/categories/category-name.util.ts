 * One definition of how a category is named to, and named by, an LLM.
 *
 * Two categories may share a leaf name -- "Cell Phone" under both "Bills" and
 * "Business" is the ordinary case, not an edge case -- so the leaf name alone
 * identifies nothing. Everything an AI or MCP tool shows the user therefore
 * carries the parent ({@link qualifiedCategoryName}), and everything a tool
 * accepts back is resolved through {@link resolveCategoryNamePaths}, which
 * refuses an ambiguous name instead of picking a winner.
 *
 * The pair is the point: a name we emit must resolve back to the category we
 * emitted it for. `category-name.util.spec.ts` asserts exactly that round trip
 * over a tree with duplicate leaf names, because the two halves were previously
 * written four times between them and disagreed -- the resolver accepted
 * `"Business:Cell Phone"` and `"Business : Cell Phone"` but not
 * `"Business: Cell Phone"`, the one spelling the tool descriptions and error
 * messages tell the model to use. That miss fell through to a last-segment
 * fallback which returned *the other* "Cell Phone", and since the results were
 * labelled with the bare leaf name, nothing downstream could show that the
 * wrong category had been read.
