/**
 * Unit-test harness for the row/advisory locks in `common/db/locks`.
 *
 * The real helpers issue `SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(...)` and
 * `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` through the manager. In a unit test that manager is a
 * jest mock whose `query` is usually driven by a `mockResolvedValueOnce` chain,
 * so a lock statement would silently eat one of the spec's queued answers and
 * shift every assertion after it -- a failure that looks like a logic bug and is
 * not one.
 *
 * So specs mock the module instead:
 *
 *   jest.mock("../common/db/locks", () =>
 *     jest.requireActual("../test-helpers/locks-testing").locksMockModule(),
 *   );
 *
 * and stub the readers they depend on with `stubLockedTransaction`. Whether the
 * locks are actually *taken* is not a question a mocked manager can answer -- the
 * two-connection integration specs cover that, and `locks.spec.ts` covers the
 * SQL each helper emits.
