/**
 * `DECLARE` / `FETCH` / `CLOSE` for a mocked `manager.query`.
 *
 * The backup export reads large tables through a database cursor so that a
 * table contributes a batch of rows at a time rather than all of it (issue
 * #1070, `export-cursor.ts`). A mock that answers only the plain `SELECT` sees
 * `DECLARE ... CURSOR FOR SELECT ...` and then `FETCH FORWARD n FROM ...`, and
 * returns nothing for the second -- so every export in the suite would quietly
 * produce empty tables and every assertion about content would be vacuous.
 *
 * Wrapping a handler here keeps the specs written against the *query*: the inner
 * `SELECT` is handed to the wrapped handler exactly as it used to be, with the
 * same parameters, and its rows are served back in batches. A spec that mocks
 * `sql.includes("FROM accounts")` needs no change.
