 * context and opens a real transaction; unit tests need neither. Specs mock
 * the module so `withScopedDb(ds, fn)` simply delegates to the (mock)
 * `dataSource.transaction(fn)`:
 *
 *   jest.mock("../common/db/scoped-db", () =>
 *     jest.requireActual("../test-helpers/scoped-db-testing").scopedDbMockModule(),
 *   );
 *
 * and build the manager/dataSource pair with `createScopedDbMocks`, routing
 * `manager.getRepository(Entity)` to the same per-entity mock repositories the
 * specs already assert against. The context-throw and GUC-emission behavior of
 * the real withScopedDb stays covered by its own spec (scoped-db.spec.ts).
