 * advances only N - 1 intervals: 12 monthly payments from 2026-01-01 end on
 * 2026-12-01, not 2027-01-01. Advancing N put every displayed payoff date -- and
 * the linked scheduled transaction's `endDate` -- one full payment period late.
 *
 * The stepping is `calculateNextDueDate`, the recurrence engine that will
 * actually post those payments, rather than a second calendar of its own. That
 * is not a preference: this date's whole job is to bound the linked scheduled
 * transaction, so it has to be a date the scheduler reaches. A hand-rolled
 * semi-monthly step (1st, 15th, 1st...) against the engine's (15th, last day of
 * month...) put the final installment past its own `endDate`, and the schedule
 * posted 23 of 24 payments. It follows that month-end drift here is whatever the
