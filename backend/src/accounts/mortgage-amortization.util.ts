/**
 * Mortgage Amortization Utility Functions
 *
 * Key differences from loan amortization:
 * - Canadian fixed-rate mortgages: semi-annual compounding (required by law),
 *   converted to the payment period by `calculateCanadianPeriodicRate`.
 * - Every other mortgage (Canadian variable-rate, US/other): the quoted rate is
 *   a *nominal annual rate compounded at the payment frequency*, so the periodic
 *   rate is `annualRate / periodsPerYear` -- see
 *   `calculateStandardPeriodicRate` for why that is the convention and not
 *   monthly compounding converted to the period.
 * - Supports additional payment frequencies including accelerated options
 * - Calculates payment amount based on amortization period
