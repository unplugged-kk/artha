 * bulk and split routes while the dedicated status endpoint
 * (`PATCH /transactions/:id/status`) and the generic row update
 * (`PATCH /transactions/:id`) stayed open -- the least-guarded entry point into
 * exactly the states those routes refuse (recheck of P5-001 scenario B and
 * FR-002).
 *
 * 1. A split-transfer counterpart leg cannot cross the boundary alone: the
 *    parent's split row and total would still record money that left the
 *    source and never arrived. Refuse and point at the parent, which already
 *    has a propagation path.
 * 2. A mirror transfer leg shares the movement of money, so the counterpart
 *    crosses with it and its balance is adjusted by its OWN contribution --
 *    read under the same lock every other balance delta is derived under. A
 *    counterpart that does not lock (a cross-owner leg in another tenant's
 *    scope) is left alone: inclusion is per ledger there, decided per row.
