/**
 * What makes an unreconciled transaction *overdue*.
 *
 * A scheduled bill is overdue when its due date has passed. A transaction has
 * no due date, so "overdue" has to be defined against the reconciliation the
 * user actually performs -- and only for the accounts they reconcile at all.
 * An account nobody has ever reconciled has no stale rows, however old: the
 * user has not opted into reconciliation there, and telling them a two-year-old
 * coffee is outstanding would make the reminder worthless everywhere else.
 *
 * For an account with at least one RECONCILED row there are two ways a
 * non-reconciled, non-void register row is overdue, and they are reported as
 * distinct reasons because they call for different actions:
 *
 * - `missed` -- the row is dated on or before the account's most recent
 *   reconciled date. The statement covering it has already been reconciled and
 *   this row was left out of it, so the reconciled balance and the bank's
 *   disagree by its amount. This is the exact analogue of an overdue bill and
 *   needs no threshold to state.
 * - `overdue` -- the row is newer than that, but older than
 *   `STALE_UNRECONCILED_DAYS`. Nothing is provably wrong yet; the user has
 *   simply not reconciled the period it belongs to. This is the case that
 *   catches an account whose reconciliation has quietly stopped, which `missed`
 *   alone never can -- every row after the last reconciled date looks like it
 *   belongs to the statement still to come.
 *
 * The two are disjoint by construction: `missed` is decided first, so a row is
 * counted once and the counts sum to the total.
 */

/**
 * How long a register row may sit unreconciled, past the account's last
 * reconciled date, before it is called overdue.
 *
 * One monthly statement cycle plus a fortnight of slack: a statement dated the
 * 1st is typically reconciled within a week or two of arriving, so 45 days is
 * comfortably past "the user is getting to it" without waiting for a second
 * cycle to go by. It is a judgement, not a derivation, which is why it lives
 * here as one exported constant rather than as a literal in a query -- the
 * frontend highlight and the reminder count have to agree about it, and the
 * response carries the number so the client never restates it.
