   * `toCurrencyCode`, `exchangeRate` (validated only `@Min(0)`) and `toAmount`:
   *
   * - A cross-currency transfer with no rate defaulted to 1, so 100 USD landed
   *   as 100 EUR. Scheduled transfers hit this every time: the schedule carries
   *   only the source currency, so it supplied no target currency, no rate and
   *   no destination amount.
   * - The destination row was labelled with the source currency, contaminating
   *   every later conversion that read it.
   * - An explicit `toAmount` overrode everything with no conservation check, so
   *   `amount=100, toAmount=80` between two same-currency accounts destroyed 20.
   *
   * The rules now:
   * - Currency codes come from the accounts. A request that names a different
   *   one is rejected rather than persisted.
   * - Same currency: the destination amount equals the source amount. An
   *   explicit `toAmount` that disagrees is a rejection, not an override --
   *   there is no rate or fee that can make a same-currency transfer unequal.
   * - Different currencies: an explicit `toAmount` is honoured (a bank's actual
   *   settlement figure, which legitimately differs from spot by fees), and
   *   otherwise the rate is resolved server-side -- the supplied one if it is
   *   strictly positive, else the market rate for the transfer date, else the
   *   latest stored rate. If none can be found the transfer is refused rather
   *   than posted at 1:1.
   *
   * Direction is destination-currency units per one source-currency unit.

   * FX for an *edit*, which is not the same question as FX for a creation.

   * `resolveTransferFx` answers "what does this transfer settle at", and calling
   * it on every edit made two things go wrong (recheck RR2-003 and RR2-004):
   *
   * - A presentation-only edit re-resolved the rate. Changing a description on a
   *   100 USD -> 90 EUR transfer resolved today's rate, and since the FR-007 fix
   *   writes a resolved rate whenever it differs from the row's, the row became
   *   90 EUR at 0.80 -- an internally inconsistent pair, from an edit that touched
   *   no money. Worse, the same edit was *refused* when no current rate existed,
   *   even though the transfer already held a perfectly good settlement.
   * - When resolution genuinely applied, only part of the tuple was persisted.
   *   Moving the destination leg to a GBP account with no explicit amount wrote
   *   the account, the currency and the rate, and left the old EUR *number* on the
   *   row: 90 GBP at 0.80 against a 100 USD source, with the balance already moved
   *   by 80. The next recompute silently changed the account by the difference.
   *
   * So: re-price only when the financial structure changed -- either account, the
   * source amount, an explicit destination amount, or an explicit rate -- and when
   * it did, `repriced` tells the builders to write the whole resolved tuple.
   *
   * A date change deliberately does *not* re-price. The rate a transfer settled at
   * is a fact about the transfer, not a function of the date field, and correcting
   * a mistyped date should not restate what the bank actually paid -- nor be
   * refused because that day has no stored rate. A user who wants the new date's
   * rate supplies a rate or a destination amount, which does re-price.
   *
   * A supplied currency code is still validated against its account either way, so
   * a mismatched code cannot ride in on a presentation-only edit.
