/**
 * Every write path a user can reach that alters an existing transaction, and
 * the function inside each that must refuse a reconciled row.
 *
 * The strict lock is only as good as its least-guarded entry point, and this
 * codebase has the scar to prove the general form of that: a refusal added to
 * the single-row transfer route was walked around by `bulkUpdate`, which
 * expands a transfer leg to its counterpart. So the rule is a scan rather than
 * a paragraph -- a new mutation route that locks a transaction row and does not
 * ask this question fails here, wherever it is added.
 *
 * The list may grow. Removing an entry means the route no longer writes to a
 * transaction, which is a change worth arguing for in the diff.

 * named first write of the method. A site without `beforeWrite` opens its own
