 * An occurrence's identity is a recurrence slot, and the constraint that

 *
 * The table's uniqueness used to name `override_date` while every read, the
 * refusal in `createOverride`, `docs/financial-semantics.md` and a comment in
 * the expander all said `original_date`. Nothing failed: the constraint was
 * real, the claims were plausible, and the disagreement only showed up as two
 * overrides replacing one occurrence with row order deciding which one posted.
 *
 * So the check is not "is there a unique constraint" -- there was -- but "does
 * it cover the columns the code keys on, and does the code name it correctly".
