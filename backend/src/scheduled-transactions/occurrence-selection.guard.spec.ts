 * Occurrence selection is one decision, made in one place (issue #1247,

 *
 * The first pass at #1247 centralized the *arithmetic* -- what a schedule costs
 * at today's rate -- and left every consumer to work out which occurrence was
 * due and which override governed it. They did not agree: the budget alert path
 * keyed the override lookup on `overrideDate` when the identity is
 * `originalDate` (so a moved occurrence silently read the template), the
 * Upcoming Bills report applied one schedule-level amount to every projected
 * occurrence, and AI/MCP reported the base for an occurrence the user had
 * re-priced. An import-presence scan cannot see any of that, which is why this
 * guard is about the *shapes* those mistakes take.
 *
 * Each allowlist entry below is a reviewed decision with a reason. Adding a file
 * to one is a deliberate act; the default is to go through
 * `ScheduledOccurrenceService`.
