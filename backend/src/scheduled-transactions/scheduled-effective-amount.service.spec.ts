 * The effective-amount contract (issue #1247), exercised on the two scenarios the
 * issue names: a persisted amount whose currency pair has since changed (stale),
 * and a pair whose current rate cannot be resolved (unknown).
 *
 * The numbers are the issue's own worked example: 10 shares at 100 EUR settling
 * into a CAD account, pinned at 1.50 EUR/CAD, so the stored amount is -1,500 CAD
 * -- and after the security's currency changes to USD at 1.35 USD/CAD the same
 * occurrence posts -1,350 CAD. Every assertion below also states what must NOT
 * come back, because the defect is a plausible number, not an error.
