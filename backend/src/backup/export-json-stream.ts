 * The backup document, produced as a sequence of bounded JSON fragments.

 * The export used to build one string per table (`JSON.stringify(rows)`) and
 * hand it to gzip. That reads as streaming -- a table at a time -- and is not:
 * the array, and then a string of the whole array, are both live at the moment
 * of the call, so peak memory tracked the largest table rather than the chunk
 * size. With `attachment_blobs` holding every receipt as base64 that was the
 * whole dataset (issue #1070, F3RB-006).
 *
 * So the document is assembled here instead, one row at a time, and flushed
 * whenever the accumulated text passes `EXPORT_CHUNK_BYTES`. What is resident is
 * a batch of rows, one serialised row, and at most one chunk of text.
 *
 * **The floor is one row.** A single 10 MiB attachment is 13.6 MiB of base64
 * whatever the budget says, because a row is serialised whole. The budget bounds
 * accumulation, not the largest individual value, and no cursor can change that.
