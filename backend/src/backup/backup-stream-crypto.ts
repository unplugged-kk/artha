 * emitted until the last byte of plaintext is known -- which is why the encrypted
 * export held the entire artifact in memory and why the memory ceiling that
 * refused large encrypted exports existed at all (issue #1070). Sealing fixed-size
 * frames instead makes the ciphertext writable incrementally, at the cost of 20
 * bytes per frame and a construction that has to defend the boundaries between
 * them. `backup-envelope.ts` documents the format and what each field defends.
