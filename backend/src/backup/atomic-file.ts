/**
 * Crash-atomic file writes for automatic backups.
 *
 * The automatic backup wrote its payload with `fs.writeFile` straight onto the
 * final, predictable filename, and promoted daily to weekly/monthly with
 * `copyFileSync` onto another final filename. Both truncate first and fill
 * afterwards, so a process kill, an ENOSPC or a container eviction between the
 * two leaves a partial file under a name that looks finished. It has a valid
 * `.json.gz`/`.mzbe` extension, it sorts newest, retention counts it, and an
 * operator reaching for the most recent recovery point picks it. Nothing in the
 * artifact says it is truncated -- gzip only complains at the end, which is
 * exactly where the bytes stop.
 *
 * So: write to a temporary name in the same directory, flush it to disk, rename
 * it over the final name, and flush the directory entry too. `rename(2)` within
 * a filesystem is atomic, so the final name never names a partial file -- a
 * reader sees either the previous artifact or the complete new one.
 *
 * Temporary names start with a dot and carry the pid, so they are invisible to
 * the retention patterns (which anchor on `monize-backup-`) and attributable
 * when one is left behind. `cleanStaleTempFiles` removes leftovers separately
 * from retention, because a crashed write is not a backup and must not count
 * against the number of backups kept.
