  /**
   * Remove the objects the restore displaced, after it has committed.
   *
   * A destructive restore deletes every `transaction_attachments` row the user
   * had. For `local` and `s3` the bytes are not in those rows, so they used to
   * stay in the volume or the bucket forever, referenced by nothing -- a receipt
   * or a medical document surviving the replacement of the account it belonged
   * to, and still present in whatever backs that storage up. The metadata was
   * gone, so nothing could ever find them again to clean them up either.
   *
   * Three constraints decide when and what:
   *
   * - **After the commit.** Bytes deleted before it that the transaction then
   *   rolls back leave a metadata row promising a download that does not exist,
   *   which the user cannot distinguish from a working attachment. Orphaned bytes
   *   cost storage; a row pointing at nothing costs trust. That is the same rule
   *   `AttachmentsService.remove` follows.
   * - **Only keys the target user held.** Not the old keys named by the uploaded
   *   file: a cross-user restore on the same instance legitimately reads another
   *   user's objects as its source, and the same backup may be restored more than
   *   once. Deleting those would break both.
   * - **Never a key just staged.** Restoring a backup taken from this same
   *   account re-uses ids, so a displaced key and a newly written key can be the
   *   same string. Deleting it would remove the bytes the restore just committed
   *   metadata for.
   * - **Never a key the backup reads as its source.** This is the one that bit:
   *   a backup taken from this account names the keys this account currently
   *   holds, so its source objects *are* its displaced objects. Deleting them
   *   left the artifact naming bytes that no longer existed -- the first restore
   *   worked, and a second restore of the same file skipped every attachment and
   *   then deleted the copy the first restore had made, losing the content
   *   entirely while still reporting success.
   *
   *   So when a key is both an orphan and a source, the source wins. That keeps
   *   an object nothing in the database references, which is exactly what this
   *   method exists to remove -- and it is the right way round: an orphaned copy
   *   of the user's own receipt costs storage, while a backup that can only be
   *   restored once costs the receipt. `stageAttachmentObjects` says the same
   *   thing from the other side, and the two used to contradict each other.
   *
   * Best-effort per key: a storage error here must not turn a completed restore
   * into a failure, since the database is already the backup's. It is logged.

  /**
   * Makes every restored attachment's bytes reachable under the key its
   * restored metadata will name -- or drops the metadata row and says so.
   *
   * **Two paths, and the first is the one new artifacts take.** A backup now
   * carries attachment bytes for *every* provider, base64 in `attachment_blobs`
   * (see `externalAttachmentRows`). When the bytes are in the artifact the
   * restore uses them directly -- validates them against their own metadata, and
   * places them where this runtime keeps its attachments (in the blob rows for the
   * `database` provider, in the object store for `local`/`s3`, whichever the target
   * runs, rewriting `storage_provider` to match). No object outside the file is
   * read, so no ownership question arises: the bytes are the user's own download.
   * This is what makes a fresh instance and a deleted-metadata account recoverable
   * (F3R5-001).
   *
   * **The second path is the legacy one**, for an artifact produced before bytes
   * travelled. Those carried only metadata for `local`/`s3`, whose objects live
   * outside Postgres under a `storage_key` that equals the attachment's UUID. The
   * restore mints a fresh UUID per row, so the metadata came back pointing at
   * `<new-uuid>` while the object was still at `<old-uuid>`: unreachable after a
   * restore that reported success. So for those the bytes are *copied* from the old
   * key to the new -- and only after the restoring user is shown to own a matching
   * row, because an uploaded id cannot authorize reading a deployment-wide object
   * (F3RRR-001). On a fresh instance that ownership row does not exist and the
   * attachment is skipped, which is exactly why the bytes now travel.
   *
   * Preserving the old key instead of copying would be worse than the original
   * bug: the bytes were not in those older backups, so a restore into a different
   * user on the same instance would hand that user working links to attachments
   * whose contents they were never sent.
   *
   * Either way, a carried or copied object is checked against the size and SHA-256
   * its metadata claims, all before the destructive delete, so a missing or corrupt
   * object cannot be discovered halfway through.
   *
   * An object that cannot be staged is not restorable, and a metadata row
   * pointing at nothing is a broken attachment the user cannot tell from a
   * working one. Refusing the whole restore over a receipt image would be the
   * wrong trade -- the ledger is the point -- so the row is dropped and
   * counted, and the count is reported separately from `restored` rather than
   * added to it.
   *
   * **The right to read a source object comes from the database, not the file.**
   * Before any external object is read, the restoring user must currently own an
   * attachment with that original id, on this provider, with the same byte size
   * and SHA-256 *as stored* -- checked against `transaction_attachments`, which is
   * still intact because staging runs before the destructive delete. A row that
   * fails is unrestorable and is dropped and counted.
   *
   * Two earlier versions of this got it wrong in the same way, and the second was
   * a fix for the first:
   *
   *  1. The destination came from `row.storage_key`, and a key not recognised as a
   *     remapped id was treated as legacy or operator-chosen -- skip the load, the
   *     checksum and the copy, because the object supposedly already sat where the
   *     metadata pointed. A crafted backup could name any valid key, including
   *     another tenant's, and the row was inserted under the uploader's `user_id`.
   *  2. So the keys were derived from the id remap instead, with "a row whose id is
   *     not in the map did not come from this backup's graph" as the boundary. But
   *     the graph is the *uploaded* graph: `collectRowIdRemap` admits every
   *     UUID-shaped `row.id` in the file, so the check could never fire for a
   *     well-formed crafted row. Put the victim's attachment id in `row.id` --
   *     along with the size and hash from any standard backup, which carries
   *     external attachment metadata -- and the restore read their object and
   *     copied it under the attacker's ownership. The uploaded document was
   *     authorizing itself.
   *
   * Which field is trusted was never the question. **No unsigned value from the
   * file can establish ownership** -- not a key, not an id, not a checksum, not a
   * byte count. Only a record the server already holds can.
   *
   * The consequence is deliberate: restoring one user's backup into a *different*
   * user on the same instance now skips external attachments rather than
   * disclosing them, and a fresh instance skips them because the objects are not
   * there. That is the same conclusion the original analysis reached about
   * preserving the old key, applied to reading it.
   *
   * Returns the keys written and the source keys consumed, so a failed database
   * transaction can remove the former and the post-commit cleanup can spare the
   * latter -- see `deleteDisplacedAttachmentObjects`.
