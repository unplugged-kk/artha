/**
 * How the export reads rows out of its snapshot.
 *
 * Two shapes, deliberately, because the export asks two different questions:
 *
 *  - `read` runs a query whose whole result the caller intends to hold. It is
 *    for the small, bounded reads -- a schema lookup, a handful of counters --
 *    and every use of it is a decision that the result cannot grow with the
 *    user's data.
 *  - `rows` runs the same query through a **cursor** and hands back batches, so
 *    the number of rows resident at once is the batch size rather than the
 *    table. This is the one that closed issue #1070: `manager.query` materialises
 *    every row the query returns before the first byte can be written, so a
 *    `SELECT` over `attachment_blobs` -- base64 text, potentially the largest
 *    thing in the database -- put the entire attachment set on the heap whatever
 *    the caller then did with it.
 *
 * Both run inside the caller's `REPEATABLE READ` transaction, so a cursor sees
 * exactly the snapshot the rest of the export does. That is also why the cursor
 * needs no `WITH HOLD`: it lives and dies with the transaction that declared it.
