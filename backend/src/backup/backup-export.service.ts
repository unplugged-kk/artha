/**
 * Everything that reads a user's data out into a backup artifact: the
 * `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot every table is read under, the per-table queries,
 * the streamed and buffered assemblies, the attachment bytes an object store has
 * to contribute, and the completeness report that says whether the artifact is
 * a backup of everything it names.
 *
 * Split out of `BackupService` (issue #1092). It knows nothing about restore:
 * the only thing the two halves share is the file format in `backup-format.ts`.
 *
 * ## What bounds the memory (issue #1070)
 *
 * Every export path here is a pull pipeline, and each stage bounds the next:
 *
 *  - `export-cursor.ts` fetches rows through a database cursor, so a table
 *    contributes a batch at a time rather than all of it. `attachment_blobs`
 *    fetches one row -- one base64-encoded object -- at a time.
 *  - `export-json-stream.ts` serialises one row at a time and flushes at a byte
 *    budget, instead of `JSON.stringify`-ing a whole table.
 *  - `export-attachments.ts` opens one object store object at a time, and reaches
 *    the completeness verdict from digests rather than from bytes, so the answer
 *    exists before the first byte without the bytes existing at all.
 *  - `export-writer.ts` resolves each write only once the pipeline has taken it,
 *    so a slow client stops the reads rather than queueing behind them, and an
 *    encrypted export writes a framed container instead of one AES-GCM message
 *    over the whole artifact.
 *
 * The irreducible part is one row: a 10 MiB attachment is 13.6 MiB of base64 no
 * matter what the budget says. Everything else is a constant.
 */

/**
 * How long an export may sit idle inside its snapshot transaction before the
 * database aborts it.
 *
 * The streaming export writes to the client between table reads, so a client
 * that stops draining holds the snapshot open -- and a long-lived
 * `REPEATABLE READ` transaction blocks vacuum from reclaiming dead tuples for
 * the whole database, not just this user's tables. Bounding the idle time turns
 * that from an operational problem into a failed download the user can retry
 * (audit DR-04).
