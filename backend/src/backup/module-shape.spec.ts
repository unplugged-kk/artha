 * The shape issue #1092 put the backup module into, held by a scan rather than a
 * paragraph.
 *
 * `BackupService` reached 2,600 lines because nothing failed while it grew. Every
 * individual addition was small and belonged somewhere in the file, and the
 * argument that backup-core changes cannot be split across independent PRs --
 * which is true -- was read as an argument that they cannot be split at all. Both
 * rules below are the parts of "keep it bounded" a machine can check: a file that
 * crosses the ceiling, and a facade that starts making decisions again.
