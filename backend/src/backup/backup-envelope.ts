/**
 * The encrypted-backup envelope, shared by both container versions.
 *
 * Monize has two, and the second exists because the first cannot stream:
 *
 * ```
 * v1 (monolithic)
 *   bytes  0..3   magic       "MZBE"
 *   byte   4      version     0x01
 *   byte   5      kdf         0x01 = scrypt
 *   bytes  6..21  salt        16 bytes
 *   bytes 22..33  iv          12 bytes
 *   bytes 34..49  authTag     16 bytes
 *   bytes 50..    ciphertext  gzip(JSON)
 *
 * v2 (framed)
 *   bytes  0..3   magic       "MZBE"
 *   byte   4      version     0x02
 *   byte   5      kdf         0x01 = scrypt
 *   bytes  6..21  salt        16 bytes
 *   bytes 22..28  noncePrefix 7 bytes
 *   bytes 29..    frames      [uint32 BE length][ciphertext||tag] ...
 * ```
 *
 * A v1 auth tag covers the whole payload, so it cannot be computed until the last
 * byte of plaintext exists -- which is why the encrypted export buffered the
 * entire artifact in memory (issue #1070). v2 authenticates each frame on its
 * own, so the writer can emit as it goes.
 *
 * Every field a v2 frame needs to be unambiguous is in its nonce, following the
 * STREAM construction: `noncePrefix || counter || finalFlag`. A frame therefore
 * cannot be reordered (the counter is different), duplicated (likewise), moved
 * into another file (the prefix and the key are different), or dropped from the
 * end -- the frame that would become last was sealed with `finalFlag = 0` and is
 * opened expecting `1`. Truncation is the attack a naive chunked format gets
 * wrong: without the flag, half a backup decrypts cleanly and restores as if it
 * were the whole thing.
 *
 * The header is additional authenticated data for every frame, so the salt and
 * the prefix cannot be swapped either.
 */

/**
 * scrypt at N=32768 takes roughly 100ms of pure CPU. `scryptSync` spent that on
 * the event loop, and a restore tries up to three candidate passwords -- so one
 * request stalled every other request in the process for about a third of a
 * second. The async form runs the derivation on the libuv threadpool instead.
