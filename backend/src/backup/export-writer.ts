/**
 * The write end of an export: JSON text in, gzip (and optionally an encrypted
 * container) out, to whatever the caller is writing to.
 *
 * Three things it exists to get right, all of which were wrong or absent before
 * issue #1070:
 *
 *  - **Backpressure.** `write` resolves when the pipeline has taken the chunk, so
 *    a slow client stops the reader inside the snapshot instead of letting an
 *    unbounded queue grow behind it. The generator feeding this is pulled, so
 *    "stop taking chunks" really does stop the database reads.
 *  - **Encryption without buffering.** A password produces a framed container
 *    (`backup-stream-crypto.ts`) rather than one AES-GCM message over the whole
 *    artifact, so the encrypted path streams like the plain one instead of
 *    assembling the entire backup in memory to compute a single auth tag.
 *  - **Not hanging when the client leaves.** A naked `drain` wait never settles
 *    for a cancelled download, and the export holds a `REPEATABLE READ`
 *    transaction and a pooled connection for as long as it is waiting. `close`
 *    and `error` on the target reject the pending operation, so the snapshot
 *    unwinds (PR1077-REV-004).
