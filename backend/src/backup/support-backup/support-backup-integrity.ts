 * Referential-integrity scrub for trimmed exports. Account scoping and date

 * make the file unrestorable (the restore inserts most FKs inline and
 * re-applies the deferred ones with an unconditional UPDATE). Instead of
 * patching individual columns per feature, this pass walks a declarative map
 * of every FK between exported tables and repairs each dangling reference:
 *
 * - `null`: clear the column (nullable FKs -- lost cross-link, row survives),
 * - `dropRow`: remove the row (NOT NULL FKs, junction rows, or rows that are
 *   meaningless without their target, e.g. a transfer split whose target
 *   account is gone -- keeping it with a null would violate a CHECK
 *   constraint).
 *
 * The map lists physical FKs from database/schema.sql between tables that the
 * support backup exports. FKs to `users` and `currencies` are excluded: users
 * is never exported (restore rescopes user_id) and currencies are restored by
 * code, not by id.
