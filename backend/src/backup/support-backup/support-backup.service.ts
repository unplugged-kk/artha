   * For a row a user created, all three are free text: the code is any three
   * characters, the name is up to 100, the symbol up to 10. So a currency called
   * `KEN / Kenneth Lasko Family Credits / KL` travelled unchanged inside an
   * artifact documented as de-identified, next to the masked payee and account
   * names it contradicted. Encryption does not help: it protects the file in
   * transit, and the recipient is the person the masking is for.
   *
   * Canonical rows (`created_by_user_id IS NULL`) keep everything -- they are
   * genuinely public, and masking `USD` would make a reproduction harder to read
   * for no gain.
   *
   * The replacement code is random per export rather than derived from the
   * original, so two artifacts from the same user cannot be lined up by it. It
   * stays three characters (the column's width, and what every reference
   * expects), and avoids both the codes already in this payload and the curated
   * catalog, so a pseudonym can never be mistaken for a real currency.
   *
   * `decimal_places` is kept: it is the arithmetic, and changing it would alter
   * every amount's meaning in a file whose whole purpose is reproducing a
   * calculation.
   *
   * References are rewritten through `CURRENCY_REFERENCE_COLUMNS` -- named
   * columns, not a string sweep. A three-character code appears by chance inside
   * masked text often enough that a generic walker would corrupt unrelated
   * values, and the schema-scanning guard in
   * `currencies/currency-references.spec.ts` is what keeps the named list honest.
   *
   * `created_by_user_id` is rewritten to the exporting user's own id, which
   * `remapIdentifiers` then replaces along with everything else. Currencies are
   * shared, and the export deliberately includes every code the user's data
   * references whoever defined it -- so a custom currency another user of the same
   * instance created arrives here carrying *that* user's real UUID. It has no
   * `id` column for the row-id sweep to catch, so the value would survive
   * remapping verbatim and defeat the one thing remapping is for: two support
   * files from two users of one instance could be lined up by the creator id they
   * share. The restore overwrites this column with the restoring user's id in any
   * case, so nothing downstream depends on the original.
