/**
 * Whether an artifact will carry the bytes of every attachment it names, decided
 * **before** the first byte is written and without holding any of those bytes.
 *
 * Two rules meet here and neither may give way:
 *
 *  - A download the server knows cannot restore everything it names says so in
 *    its own headers and filename (F3RB-004), which means the verdict has to
 *    exist before anything reaches the socket.
 *  - Peak memory must not track the size of the attachment set (F3RB-006, issue
 *    #1070), which rules out the old answer -- read every blob and every object
 *    into arrays, assemble, then judge what was assembled.
 *
 * So the verdict is reached from digests rather than from bytes. For the
 * `database` provider Postgres computes `octet_length` and `sha256` over the
 * column and only those travel; for `local`/`s3` each object is opened, checked
 * and dropped, one at a time. That costs the external stores a second read of
 * each object when the body is written -- the deliberate price of knowing the
 * answer before the download starts, and it is bounded work rather than bounded
 * memory being traded away.

 * `database`-provider bytes used to travel; for `local` and `s3` the artifact
 * carried metadata and the operator was told to restore the sidecar volume or
 * bucket alongside it. That works only while the *target* database still holds
 * the matching row, because the restore has to prove the caller is entitled to
 * read the object before it reads it -- and after the ownership fix, the proof is
 * a current `transaction_attachments` row. So the two cases backups exist for
 * both failed: a fresh instance has no such row, and an account whose attachment
 * was deleted has no such row either.
 *
 * There is no way to fix that with a better ownership check. An identifier, a
 * size and a hash in an uploaded document cannot establish a right to read an
 * object, however they are combined. The only thing that can is the bytes being
 * *in* the artifact the user downloaded, which is what this does.
 *
 * What it no longer costs is memory. This used to build one array of every
 * carried object, base64-encoded, before serialisation began -- thirty 10 MiB
 * receipts are ~400 MiB of text on a pod the chart sizes at 400 MiB. Yielding a
 * row at a time means one object is resident, and the writer drops it as soon as
 * gzip has taken it (issue #1070).
 *
 * `only`, when given, is the audit's verdict: the ids whose bytes were read and
 * verified before the download started. Rows outside it are skipped without a
 * read, so the body cannot carry an object the headers said was missing.
