/**
 * Where a user's automatic backups may be written, and where they may not.
 *
 * Two problems lived in this area, and they compound.
 *
 * **The namespace was shared.** The default folder is deployment-wide and the
 * filenames carried frequency and date and nothing else. Two users keeping the
 * default therefore wrote `monize-backup-daily-2026-08-01.json.gz` to the same
 * path on the same day -- the second replaced the first -- and retention
 * enumerated the whole folder with global patterns and applied whichever user's
 * counts it was running for. A user with a 2-day window deleted a user with a
 * 30-day window's history. One replica and two users is enough; the encryption
 * extension avoided one same-day collision and no part of the retention problem,
 * because both `.json.gz` and `.mzbe` are enumerated.
 *
 * **The destination was unrestricted.** The folder endpoints require
 * authentication and nothing else -- no admin role -- and validation asked only
 * for an absolute, normalised, writable directory. So any user could enumerate
 * the container filesystem through `browse-folders` and point their backups at
 * any writable path in it: `/tmp`, a mounted secret, another tenant's directory.
 * The lexical `safePath` guard protected the generated *filename* against
 * traversal, never the chosen directory. And because nothing canonicalised the
 * path, a symlink inside an otherwise-acceptable directory redirected the write
 * outside it.
 *
 * So a destination now has to satisfy both: it is contained in an
 * operator-approved root, canonically and not just lexically, and the file goes
 * in a server-computed per-user subdirectory of it that the user cannot name.

 * tightening: a deployment where users had chosen folders elsewhere must list
 * them here, and until it does those backups are refused with an error naming
 * the variable. Refusing loudly is the right failure -- the alternative is
 * keeping a hole open because closing it is inconvenient, and the hole is
 * "any authenticated user can write anywhere the process can".
