/**
 * The longest a single S3 operation may run, end to end, before it is aborted.
 *
 * This is a *correctness* bound, not a tuning knob. The orphan sweeper quarantines
 * a swept upload intent for `LATE_WRITE_QUARANTINE_MS` (6 hours) and re-deletes the
 * key on each pass, on the assumption that a `PutObject` cannot land after the
 * quarantine retires the row. That assumption only holds if the put cannot still be
 * in flight six hours later (audit V4R3-003, DR-V4R3-03).
 *
 * The mechanism is an `AbortController` armed around the whole operation --
 * `withDeadline` below -- not the socket timers. Socket-level timeouts
 * (`connectionTimeout`/`requestTimeout`) are inactivity timers per attempt: an
 * endpoint that trickles one byte at a time keeps the socket busy forever without
 * ever tripping them, and the SDK retries on top, multiplying whatever bound they
 * did give. The abort signal spans connect, send, retries and body consumption, so
 * it is the number this comment can honestly promise. The socket timers are still
 * set, as hygiene, so an outright-dead peer fails fast instead of waiting for the
 * deadline.
 *
 * `ATTACHMENT_S3_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` may shorten the deadline (tests point it at a
 * deliberately stalled endpoint; operators may prefer failing faster). It can never
 * lengthen it: the quarantine math depends on this ceiling, so a configured value
 * above it is clamped down.

/**
 * Stores attachment bytes in S3-compatible object storage. Chosen by
 * ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3.
 *
 * Works with AWS S3 and any S3-compatible service (MinIO, Cloudflare R2,
 * Backblaze B2, ...) via ATTACHMENT_S3_ENDPOINT / ATTACHMENT_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE.
 * Credentials come from ATTACHMENT_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID / _SECRET_ACCESS_KEY when
 * set, otherwise from the default AWS credential chain (instance role, env, ...).
 *
 * The client is built lazily on first use so a deployment that never selects s3
 * pays nothing and never needs the bucket configured. As with the local provider,
 * bytes live outside the database but DO travel in an application backup: the
 * export reads each object and carries it base64-encoded in `attachment_blobs`,
 * and a restore stages it back through this provider -- so the bucket does not
 * have to be backed up separately.
 *
 * An artifact exported before that change carries only metadata, and
 * restoring one needs more than this store: the bytes are read from the CURRENT
 * instance and only after it confirms the user already owns a matching
 * `transaction_attachments` row (same id, provider, size, SHA-256), so on a fresh
 * instance every external attachment is skipped however faithfully the store was
 * restored.
