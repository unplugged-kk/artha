/**
 * The sweeper is the compensating half of the attachment lifecycle: it performs
 * the one operation PostgreSQL cannot roll back, after the transaction that made
 * it necessary has committed.
 *
 * Since FV4-003 the same tombstone row also serves as an **upload intent**,
 * recorded before an object is written -- so the sweeper has to tell "abandoned"
 * from "still running", and an age check cannot, because nothing bounds an upload
 * to any window (audit RV4-002). It therefore *claims* the row with a conditional
 * UPDATE before deleting anything, and `AttachmentsService.clearUploadIntent`
 * refuses when that claim is present. The upload lease only keeps the sweeper away
 * from an upload that is probably alive; the claim is what makes it safe.
 *
 * The claim settles what *metadata* may commit, and RRV4-002 is about bytes: a put
 * that stalled past its lease can land after this sweep deleted the key, and a
 * process killed before its own compensating delete leaves those bytes with no row
 * to enumerate them. So a swept upload intent is **retained** for a late-write
 * quarantine and re-swept, while an ordinary deletion record is still retired at
 * once. The two are told apart by whether the row had a lease, not by age.
