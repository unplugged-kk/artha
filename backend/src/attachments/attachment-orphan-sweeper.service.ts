/*
 * THE CLAIM
 *
 * The sweeper takes an object by claiming its tombstone first.
 *
 * A tombstone is also written as an **upload intent** before an object is put
 * (`AttachmentsService.create`), so the same row shape means two things, and an
 * age check cannot tell them apart safely: nothing bounds an upload to any
 * particular window, so a stalled object-store call or commit outlives it and the
 * sweep deletes bytes a transaction is about to reference. That is worse than the
 * orphan the intent prevents -- an orphan wastes space, this loses the user's
 * receipt behind a 201.
 *
 * So `swept_at` is set by a conditional UPDATE *before* the external delete, and
 * `AttachmentsService`'s "clear the intent" step requires it to still be NULL
 * inside the transaction that commits the metadata row. Both contend on one row,
 * so PostgreSQL picks a winner and only two outcomes exist: the uploader clears the
 * intent and its metadata commits with the bytes present, or the sweeper claims
 * first and the uploader rolls back. Metadata pointing at deleted bytes is not
 * among them (audit RV4-002).
 *
 * The upload lease (`upload_lease_expires_at`) is a separate, weaker thing: it
 * keeps the sweeper away from an upload that is probably still running, so the
 * fence above stays a safety net rather than a routine source of failed uploads.
 */

/**
 * How long a swept upload intent is kept after its object was deleted.
 *
 * The claim settles what *metadata* may commit; it cannot settle what bytes exist.
 * A put that stalled past its lease can land after the sweep has already deleted
 * the key, and a process killed before its own compensating delete leaves those
 * bytes with nothing referencing them and no tombstone to enumerate them
 * (audit RRV4-002). So the row outlives the writer: it is retained until this has
 * passed, and each hourly pass re-deletes the key -- `delete` is idempotent by
 * provider contract -- before finally retiring the row.
 *
 * Sized to outlast a stalled object-store call rather than to be exactly right;
 * being generous costs one row and one no-op delete per hour.

 * UPDATE's SET list, `upload_lease_expires_at` reads the row's *old* value, so it
 * still says whether this row was an upload intent -- which is the only thing that
 * distinguishes it from a deletion record whose bytes nothing can write again. And
 * `COALESCE` makes the window set once and never extended: a quarantined row is
 * re-claimed on every pass until it is retired, and pushing the deadline forward
 * each time would keep it forever.

 * `msParam` is the positional index of the window length; nothing interpolated here

/**
 * Deletes attachment bytes whose metadata is already gone.
 *
 * This is the compensating half of the attachment lifecycle. Metadata deletion
 * is transactional and a trigger records a tombstone with it; this service then
 * performs the one operation PostgreSQL cannot roll back, *after* that
 * transaction has committed. Ordering it that way is the point: an external
 * delete before the commit is unrecoverable if the commit then fails, while an
 * external delete after it is merely pending until the next sweep.
 *
 * A tombstone is also how an upload records its **intent** before writing bytes,
 * because "these bytes may exist and nothing references them" is equally true of
 * an upload in flight and of a metadata row that is gone. One row shape, one
 * sweeper (audit FV4-003) -- and, because those two meanings cannot be told apart
 * by age, one conditional claim that the uploader is fenced against
 * (audit RV4-002). See "THE CLAIM" at the top of this file, and
 * `AttachmentsService.clearUploadIntent` for the other half of it.
 *
 * A tombstone for another provider is left alone rather than deleted. Its bytes
 * are unreachable through the currently bound provider, so dropping the record
 * would be throwing away the only remaining pointer to the object -- an operator
 * who switches the provider back can still clean up.
