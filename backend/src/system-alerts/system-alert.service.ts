 *
 * **Fan-out**: `notifications` is RLS-keyed on `user_id`, so a deployment-wide
 * fact is materialized as one row per administrator, each independently
 * readable and dismissible. The recipient predicate is
 * `queryAdminRecipients` (`users/admin-recipients.util.ts`), shared with
 * `ProviderOutageAlertService`.
 *
 * **At-most-once**: every replica runs every cron, so each insert carries a
 * `dedupe_key` and lands as `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING id`
 * against the partial unique index `idx_notifications_dedupe`
 * (migration 170). Only the insert winner's rows email -- the same trade as
 * `ProviderOutageAlertService`: a process killed between the insert
 * committing and SMTP accepting loses that email, the in-app row survives,
 * and a duplicated admin alert is the failure mode designed against
 * (INV-ALERT-001, `docs/specs/system-alerts.md`).
 *
 * **Context**: both entry points seed their own RLS context
 * (`withSystemContext` for the admin fan-out, `withUserContext` for a
 * per-user alert), because every caller is a cron catch, a post-claim hook or
 * a bootstrap hook with no request behind it. Callers must invoke this
 * OUTSIDE any open `withScopedDb` transaction: a nested call would join the
 * caller's transaction under the caller's identity GUCs, and an alert about a
 * failure must not roll back with the work that failed.
 *
 * **Never throws**: an alert is a side reporting channel. A failure to raise
 * one is logged and swallowed so it cannot end the sweep that noticed the
 * original problem.
