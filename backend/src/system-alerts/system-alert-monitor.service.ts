 *   per ISO week while it stays unset. The startup log warning in `main.ts`
 *   stays; this is the in-app copy an operator who never reads container logs
 *   actually sees.
 *
 *   Deliberately on the sweep rather than on `onApplicationBootstrap`, for
 *   three reasons that all bit the boot-time version: a fresh install has no
 *   administrator yet when it boots, so the fan-out stood down and the alert
 *   was never raised until somebody restarted the server; a deployment that
 *   simply keeps running never re-raised it, contradicting the weekly bucket
 *   it is keyed on; and Nest awaits bootstrap hooks inside `app.listen()`, so
 *   an unreachable relay delayed the port opening by one SMTP timeout per
 *   administrator and could hold a readiness probe into a restart loop. A
 *   condition that has been true since installation can wait fifteen minutes.
 * - **SMTP delivery failing**: a 15-minute sweep over this replica's own
 *   `EmailService` failure snapshot. In-app only by definition -- the email
 *   channel cannot report itself. Skipped entirely when SMTP is not
 *   configured: unconfigured is a setup state announced at boot, not a
 *   failure.
 *
 * No database access of its own -- `SystemAlertService` seeds its own RLS
 * context -- so this file does not need the with-context lint allowlist.
