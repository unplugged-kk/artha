  /**
   * A manual price create/update/delete changes the accepted close for a
   * security, so every `monthly_account_balances` snapshot for an account
   * holding it now carries a stale `market_value`. This is the shared
   * invalidation path (#1242): before it, provider refresh and backfill
   * recomputed snapshots but the HTTP manual-price routes did not, so a
   * corrected price left the charts stale.
   *
   * Invalidation is recovered from the data, not just debounced.
   * `sweepStaleSnapshots` recovers a lost recompute by finding accounts whose
   * `updated_at` is newer than their snapshots -- but that only works if the
   * mutation advances `accounts.updated_at`. A manual price moves no balance,
   * so nothing touched the account row and the sweep had no signal: a crash
   * between the price commit and the two-second debounce timer left the
   * snapshot stale (review MZ-1242-R2). So this runs **inside the same
   * transaction as the price write**, advancing `updated_at` on every holding
   * account atomically with the price change -- the same marker an
   * investment-transaction edit leaves via its balance write. The security is
   * per-user, so every holder is an account of the same `userId`.
   *
   * One residual window remains, and it is why this says "recovered from the
   * data" rather than "crash-durable": both `now()` here and the `accounts`
   * `updated_at` trigger stamp **transaction-start** time, not the instant of
   * the write. A concurrent recompute that begins after this transaction starts
   * but commits its (still-stale) snapshots before it can leave `computed_at`
   * newer than this marker, and then the sweep's `updated_at > computed_at`
   * predicate misses the account -- so if the post-commit debounce is also lost
   * to a crash, that snapshot waits for the next touch of the account instead of
   * the sweep. The account row lock above serializes this write against such a
   * recompute of the same account, which is what narrows the window to the
   * near-impossible; the snapshot self-heals on the account's next change
   * regardless. Making the marker unconditionally crash-durable would mean
   * stamping `clock_timestamp()`, which the shared `updated_at` trigger clobbers
   * back to transaction-start for every table -- out of proportion to a window
   * this small.
   *
   * Returns the affected account ids so the caller can, after commit, schedule
   * the debounced recompute as a latency optimization on top of the marker.
