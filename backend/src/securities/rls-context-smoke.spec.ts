/**
 * RLS smoke for the securities module's cron entry points (task R3).
 *
 * Unlike the per-service specs, this suite does NOT mock `withScopedDb`: the
 * real implementation runs (at the default RLS_MODE=off), so every DB access on
 * the cron paths must find the ambient context seeded by the C2 wrappers
 * (withSystemContext / withUserContext) or withScopedDb throws its
 * missing-context error. This is the CI stand-in for the "dev smoke of the
 * module's cron paths shows no context throws" acceptance.
