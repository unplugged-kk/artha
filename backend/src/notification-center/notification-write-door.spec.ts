/**
 * The `notifications` table has one writer.
 *
 * Before `NotificationService` existed there were three, with three different
 * opinions: a raw `INSERT` for budget alerts (its own conflict target, no title
 * bound), an entity `save` for bill reminders (no conflict handling at all), and
 * a second raw `INSERT` for system alerts (its own truncation helpers and its
 * own `period_start` default). Every rule the row has to obey therefore held on
 * one path and not the others -- an over-long scheduled-transaction name raised
 * 22001 inside a never-throws catch on one of them, and the notification the
 * user needed silently never existed.
 *
 * A producer decides *what* to say. What the row looks like is not its decision,
 * so this scan fails on a second writer.
 *
 * Reads are deliberately not restricted: a producer's de-duplication query is
 * about that producer's own candidates, not about the reader's list, and
 * pretending otherwise would put budget logic in this module.
