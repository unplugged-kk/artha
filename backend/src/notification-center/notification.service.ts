/**
 * The notification table's one door, in both directions: every producer writes

 * **Why one creation door.** Before this there were three inserts with three
 * different opinions: a raw `INSERT` for budget alerts, an entity `save` for
 * bill reminders, and a second raw `INSERT` for system alerts -- so the column
 * bounds were enforced on one path, the conflict handling on another, and the
 * `period_start` default on a third. A producer decides *what* to say; the
 * shape of the row it lands in is not its decision to make.
 * `notification-write-door.spec.ts` fails on a second writer.
 *
 * **What a conflict means.** The insert is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, covering
 * both unique indexes at once: the fingerprint (a budget notification the
 * period already holds) and the dedupe key (a system notification another
 * replica already raised). `null` therefore means *somebody else holds this
 * notification*, which is what every caller needs to know -- notably, that it
 * is not theirs to email about. It is deliberately not an error: every replica
 * runs every cron, so losing the race is the normal case.
 *
 * **Context.** `withScopedDb` throws without an ambient identity, and every
 * producer here is a cron body, a post-claim hook or a bootstrap hook with no
 * request behind it -- so callers seed their own (`withUserContext` for the
 * affected user, `withSystemContext` for an admin fan-out) and this service
 * inherits it. `create` joins an ambient transaction if there is one, which is
 * why producers must call it OUTSIDE the transaction whose failure they are
 * reporting: a notification that rolls back with the work it describes is a
 * notification nobody gets.
