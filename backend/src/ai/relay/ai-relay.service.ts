   * Push a write-confirmation card to the browser parked on this user's

   * are serving a relayed prompt: instead of an MCP-client elicitation (which
   * the user would have to accept in their CLI), the approve/reject card is
   * rendered in the web chat, exactly like the native AI Assistant.
   *
   * Returns true when the card was handled by the relay (the caller is in relay
   * context and must NOT perform the write -- the browser commits it via
   * /ai/actions/confirm on approval): either delivered live, or, when the
   * browser stream already gave up while the agent composed the call, buffered
   * for pickup. Returns false only when the user has no relay turn at all (a
   * direct MCP client), so the caller falls back to its own confirmation.
   *
   * Buffering the card when the stream is gone is what fixes #793: previously a
   * card emitted after the idle timeout returned false, the write tool fell
   * through to an MCP-client elicitation the web-chat user could not answer, and
   * it surfaced as a decline.

   *    another session's write is not part of it. Matching on userId alone let
   *    one abandoned web-chat turn capture every direct write the same user
   *    made afterwards.
   *  - not unbounded in time. A late marker only stands in for a live turn for
   *    as long as the answer buffer would have held the answer; past that the
