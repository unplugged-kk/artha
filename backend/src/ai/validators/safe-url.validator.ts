/**
 * How long the safety check's DNS lookup may take before the answer is "not
 * established".
 *
 * `dns.resolve4`/`resolve6` carry no timeout of their own, so a name whose
 * authoritative nameserver never answers holds the caller for c-ares' whole
 * retry budget -- tens of seconds, on a request path, chosen by whoever supplied
 * the URL. A lookup that has not answered in this long has not established the
 * host is public, and an unestablished host is not one this server connects to,
 * so the timeout answers `false` rather than "probably fine".
 *
 * Five seconds, not two, and the difference is a decision. Bounding the lookup
 * turned a slow resolver from "allow, the HTTP request will fail" into a
 * rejection, for every caller -- including an operator saving a perfectly valid
 * `api.anthropic.com` behind an intermittent resolver, who would be told their
 * URL was the problem. A save can wait five seconds; the push sender's per-send
 * re-check cannot, and it passes its own tighter bound through
 * `validateUrlIsSafeWithin` because its budget is part of a documented request
 * worst case.
