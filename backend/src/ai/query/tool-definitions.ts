Each item includes a daysUntilDue value (negative when overdue). Each item is ONE occurrence -- the next one due -- so `nextDueDate` is the date that occurrence actually falls on (a per-occurrence override can move it off the schedule's own recurrence date) and `amount` is what that occurrence would post today in its own `currency`; it is null with `amountComplete` false when the current exchange rate behind it cannot be determined, and you must report such an item as unknown rather than guessing a figure.

The totals describe the whole window and are NOT narrowed by a `kind` filter -- filtering to deposits still reports the bills total, because a narrower question does not make the other half stop existing. Both totals are expressed in `totalsCurrency` (the user's default), NOT in the items' own currencies -- always state that code when you quote a total, and never add two items' `amount` values together yourself, because they can be in different currencies. A total is null when any item in that bucket has an unknown amount OR is in a currency with no rate into `totalsCurrency`, with the partial sum in `knownUpcomingBillsSubtotal` / `knownUpcomingDepositsSubtotal`, which you may quote only as a subtotal. `amountsComplete` says whether anything is missing; `unknownAmountItems` names the items whose own amount could not be worked out, and `missingRatePairs` names the currency pairs with no rate (a rate the user can add on the Currencies page).

This does NOT change anything immediately: it shows the user one or more confirmation cards they must explicitly approve before anything is saved. Use it only when the user clearly asks to add, edit, categorize, transfer, or delete a transaction in their latest message. Accepts NAMES for account, category, and payee -- they are resolved internally, so you do NOT need to look up IDs first. " +

      "create (transfer): { fromAccountName, toAccountName, amount, date, description?, payeeName?, categoryName?, createPayeeIfMissing?, exchangeRate?, toAmount? } -- an item is a transfer when toAccountName is present; amount is the positive transfer amount (exchangeRate/toAmount only for cross-currency); payeeName is an optional custom label for the transfer, matched to an existing payee (or created if missing, like a normal transaction) and applied to both legs (omit to leave the payee blank; blank transfer payees display as 'Transfer to/from <account>' resolved from the current account name); categoryName is an optional spending category stored on both legs (surfaces the transfer in the monthly category breakdown without counting as income/expense). " +
      "update: { transactionId, amount?, date?, payeeName?, categoryName?, description?, createPayeeIfMissing? } -- provide only the fields to change (at least one); a category-only change is just transactionId + categoryName. First call search_transactions to obtain the transactionId. Transfers are auto-detected and edited correctly; for a transfer, categoryName is stored on both legs and surfaces the transfer in the monthly category breakdown (without making it count as income/expense), and payeeName sets its custom label (matched to an existing payee or created if missing, like a normal transaction). " +
      "split transactions (create or update): add a 'splits' array of { categoryName, amount, memo? } (>= 2 lines, category splits only) instead of a single categoryName; the split amounts must sum to the transaction amount (e.g. a -100 expense split -60 Groceries / -40 Household). On create also give accountName, amount, date; on update give transactionId and splits (replaces the whole split set). Updating an EXISTING split transaction: parent fields (date, payeeName, description) work without splits, but changing its categories or its amount requires resending the COMPLETE splits array (the tool errors with instructions otherwise). Read tools return one row per split line (same transaction id, distinct splitId), and always the COMPLETE set for each transaction even when you filtered by category -- so read the current lines first, then resend all of them with your change applied. Several split transactions CAN go in one call: give each item its own complete splits array, and every row is previewed and applied with its own set (up to 25 rows). Only one proposing tool call is allowed per reply, so send them as ONE call with many items rather than several calls. Never promise cards for transactions you have not proposed. " +
      "delete: { transactionId } -- removes the transaction (and any linked transfer legs / split children). First call search_transactions to obtain the transactionId. " +
      "attachments (create or update): add an 'attachments' array naming files the user attached to their CURRENT chat message, each entry a filename (string) or 1-based position (number); the named files are saved as permanent attachments on the transaction when the card is approved. Only images and PDFs up to 5 MB can be saved (CSV/text chat files cannot). Use this when the user asks to save/attach a receipt or document they just sent -- on create the file lands on the new transaction, on update an attachments-only item is a valid edit. Send attachment items one at a time (a single item), never on transfers or delete. " +
