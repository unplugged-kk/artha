/**
 * Per-query resource budgets for the AI Assistant's tool-calling loop.
 *
 * What a sensible ceiling is depends on the provider behind the assistant. A
 * hosted frontier model plans several tool calls per turn and finishes a
 * multi-step question inside the defaults; a small local Ollama model tends to
 * issue one lookup per turn and runs out of iterations mid-investigation. So
 * the budgets are configurable -- but *where* they are configured follows who
 * owns the provider, and there are exactly two owners:
 *
 * - **The centrally managed provider** (`AI_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` and friends) is
 *   the operator's, and nobody can edit it from the UI. Its budgets come from
 *   the `AI_QUERY_*` environment variables, resolved once at startup by
 *   `resolveQueryBudgets`.
 * - **A provider a user configured themselves** is theirs, and so are its
 *   budgets: they live on the `ai_provider_configs` row, are edited in AI
 *   Settings, and fall back to the defaults below when left blank.
 *   `resolveQueryBudgetsForConfig` is the only place that decision is made.
 *
 * The environment variables deliberately do **not** apply to a user's own
 * provider. An operator sizing the loop for the model they host says nothing
 * about the model somebody else pointed at their own Ollama box, and a global
 * ceiling silently reshaping a config the user can see and edit is the kind of
 * setting that reads as broken.
 *
 * The whole set is declared as data -- default, env var name, storage column
 * and accepted range in one table -- so a new budget cannot be added without a
 * name, a column or a bound, and cannot drift out of sync with `.env.example`
 * or `database/schema.sql`, both of which `query-budgets.spec.ts` checks.
