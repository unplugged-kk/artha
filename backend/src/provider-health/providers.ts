 * Mostly market data, plus Google Places, which answers the payee contact
 * lookup. The lookup is a user-facing request rather than a background price
 * refresh, but the reason for a breaker is the same: a dead upstream must not
 * be called once per payee across a whole deployment.
 *
 * The id is what goes in `provider_health.provider` and must stay stable -- it
 * is the primary key of the durable notification state, so renaming one starts
 * a fresh outage episode and could re-send an alert. The label is what an
 * operator reads in an email.
