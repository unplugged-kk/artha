/**
 * The clients whose outbound calls have to be answerable to a circuit breaker,
 * because these are the ones a whole deployment's worth of requests fan out
 * into (issue #1265).
 *
 * Market data was the original scope. `payees/lookup/google-places` joined it
 * because the payee contact lookup has the same fan-out shape -- one request
 * per payee, from every user, against one third-party host -- even though it
 * runs in front of a waiting person rather than in a background refresh.
 *
 * Still scoped deliberately. The FX, AI, favicon, release-check and
 * breach-check callers have the same shape and are named in
 * `docs/specs/provider-outage-alerts.md` as the next adopters; widening this
 * scan before they adopt would only be a failing test nobody can fix in one
 * change.
