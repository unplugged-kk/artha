 * 2025-06-18 shape `{"elicitation":{}}` into
 * `{"elicitation":{"form":{}}}` before `getClientCapabilities()` sees it
 * (`ElicitationCapabilitySchema`'s `z.preprocess`), so every client that
 * advertises elicitation at all now looks form-capable -- the ones that answer
 * -32601, and the ones that never answer, included. Only behaviour separates
 * them, so behaviour is what we record.
 *
 *  - "unknown":  nothing observed yet.
 *  - "answers":  the client returned an accept/decline/cancel at least once, so
 *                it demonstrably shows dialogs to a human.
 *  - "silent":   the client answered for itself (rejected the method, dropped
 *                the connection, or never replied), so no human is behind it.

 * no cleanup hook to forget, and no way for one client's observed behaviour to
