 *  - "accepted": the user approved; proceed with that write.
 *  - "declined": the user answered and the answer was no (reject/cancel), or
 *    the dialog failed in a way we cannot account for; abort, so a write never
 *    happens over a user's refusal.
 *  - "unsupported": no dialog reached a human, so the caller falls back to its
 *    normal behavior. The client still gates every tool call with its own
 *    approval prompt, so this is not a consent bypass -- it is the only consent
 *    step such a client has.
 *
 * **On 2026-07-28 the answer arrives on a later call, not from a wait.** Round
 * one returns `{ ask }` carrying a sealed `requestState`; the client shows the
 * dialogs and calls the tool again with the answers. Round two re-derives the
 * items from the same arguments, checks them against the fingerprint the user
 * approved, and reads the answers. Everything the second round needs travels in
 * the result and comes back -- the server holds nothing in between, which is
 * what makes the endpoint stateless.
 *
 * **On a 2025-era connection the server asks and waits**, exactly as before,
 * because that revision has server-initiated requests and the SDK's own
 * shim is deliberately off (`legacyShim: false`): our fallback for a client
 * that cannot show a dialog is behavioural, and a shim cannot reproduce it.
 *
 * **The advertised capability is not evidence that a dialog can be shown.**
 * The SDK normalizes the legacy 2025-06-18 shape `{"elicitation":{}}` into
 * `{"elicitation":{"form":{}}}` before `getClientCapabilities()` ever sees it,
 * so `elicitation.form` is truthy for every client that advertises elicitation
 * at all -- including the ones that answer -32601 to `elicitation/create`, and
 * the ones that never answer it. That was the whole regression: those clients
 * looked form-capable, so a failure to answer was read as the user saying no
 * and every write through Claude was refused or hung until the client's own
 * deadline. `mcp-confirm.spec.ts` pins the normalization so this cannot
 * silently flip back into a load-bearing check.
 *
 * So the *outcome* carries the weight, not the capability: only a returned
 * `action` is a user's answer. The pre-check is kept because a client
 * advertising no elicitation at all still deserves to skip the round trip.
 *
 * `server` is the session's (or the request's) `McpServer`, which every tool's
 * `register` closure already holds. It carries the client's advertised
 * capabilities, the per-session record of what that client does with a dialog,
 * and the codec that seals a multi-round confirmation.
