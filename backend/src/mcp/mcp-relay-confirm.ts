 * committed via `/ai/actions/confirm` on approval, so the tool must NOT write);
 * false when this call is not part of a relay turn, so the tool falls back to
 * `confirmWrite` in the calling MCP client.
 *
 * Tools must not call `relayService.emitPendingAction` directly: the decision
 * depends on the *calling client*, which lives in the ambient MCP caller
 * context, and a call site that forgets to pass it sends a direct client's
 * confirmation to a web chat nobody is watching. `mcp-relay-confirm.spec.ts`
 * scans the tool sources and fails on a direct call.
