/**
 * Test helper: capture every tool's `registerTool` config without booting Nest.
 *
 * Shared by `mcp-annotations.spec.ts` (spec-compliance checks) and
 * `tools-list-budget.spec.ts` (payload size). It lives here rather than in a
 * spec because a spec must not be imported by another spec.
 *
 * The providers only read their service dependencies inside handlers, never
 * during `register()`, so empty mocks are sufficient to capture the configs.
 * The registration ORDER is meaningful: it is the order the SDK lists tools in,
 * which the 2026-07-28 revision asks to be deterministic.
