/**
 * Serves attachments a user uploaded with a relayed chat prompt. The browser
 * stores the bytes in the in-memory RelayAttachmentStore and the relayed prompt
 * (get_next_prompt) hands the agent a `monize-attachment://<id>` URI per file;
 * the agent reads that URI here before answering. Images are returned as a
 * base64 blob; text/CSV and text-extractable PDFs are returned as text. A PDF
 * with no text layer (scanned/image-only) or one pdf-parse cannot read falls
 * back to a base64 blob, exactly like an image, so a vision-capable client or
 * model can still read it.
 *
 * Security: the owning userId always comes from the session context, never from
 * the URI. The `{id}` is only a lookup key within that user's bucket, so a
 * forged or guessed id can never resolve another user's file.
