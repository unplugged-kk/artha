/**
 * The scenarios two rounds of independent review asked for and neither party
 * could execute: they need a live PostgreSQL and a real non-owner role, so a
 * mocked query double cannot answer them.
 *
 *  - MT-13: does the runtime role's grant surface really refuse a write to
 *    `schema_migrations` while still allowing the read?
 *  - DR-R1: is `pg_has_role(..., 'SET')` really transitive, so a two-hop
 *    membership chain through an unremarkable intermediate role is caught?
 *
 * This matters most for confidence: it is the only way to establish that the
 * startup check's central predicate behaves as the documentation says, rather
 * than as the author read it.
 *
 * The elevation/currency scenarios this file's mixed predecessor also carried
 * (RV-001, FV-003) live in rls-elevation-and-currency.integration.spec.ts.

     *    (`object_ownercheck` -> `has_privs_of_role`) walks inheritable
     *    memberships -- so an inherited owner bypasses RLS immediately, with no
     *    statement to detect.
