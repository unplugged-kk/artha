/**
 * Lease ownership across a rolling deployment (audit V4R3-004).
 *
 * Migration 142 gave a lease a `lease_token` and the new `release`/`markDelivered`
 * filter on it, which protects new code from new code. The previous binary names
 * the work and not the holder:
 *
 *     DELETE FROM job_claims WHERE claim_type=$1 AND user_id=$2 AND claim_key=$3
 *     UPDATE job_claims SET delivered_at=now(), expires_at=NULL WHERE <same key>
 *
 * so during a rollout a stalled old pod can delete or mark a lease a new pod has
 * retaken. Migration 143's triggers make a live tokenized lease mutable only by the
 * session that declares its token in `app.job_claim_lease_token`. This exercises the
 * literal previous-release statements against the migrated schema -- which a mocked
 * repository cannot do, because the property is the interaction between an
 * untokenized statement and the trigger.
