 * INV-REPORT-001 against a real PostgreSQL database: a report's account scope is
 * investment LINKAGE, never account type.
 *
 * An INVESTMENT account is a pair -- an `INVESTMENT_CASH` sleeve holding real
 * money and an `INVESTMENT_BROKERAGE` sleeve holding securities -- so the old
 * `AND a.account_type != 'INVESTMENT'` deleted the cash sleeve's whole ledger
 * from fifteen report queries, salary deposits included (issue #1257). The
 * rows that must go are the cash legs a trade generates, which the account-type
 * filter never described in the first place.
 *
 * The unit specs mock `manager.query`, so they can only assert the text of the
 * SQL. This suite runs it: it reproduces the issue's scenario with the real
 * writer (`InvestmentTransactionsService.create` posts the cash leg) and checks
 * both directions -- what must now appear, and what must still not.
