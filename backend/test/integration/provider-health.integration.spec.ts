/**
 * INV-PROVIDER-001's two SQL-resident halves, against a real PostgreSQL.
 *
 * Everything else about the breaker is TypeScript and is covered by unit specs.
 * These two are not:
 *
 * 1. **The episode start survives a restart.** It survives because of a `CASE`
 *    inside the upsert, evaluated by the database against the row already
 *    stored. A mocked manager can only show that the statement text was sent --
 *    and the whole point of the property is what PostgreSQL does with it, since
 *    a restarted process has a fresh in-memory `failingSince` that would
 *    otherwise reset the fifteen-minute alert gate on every restart the outage
 *    provokes (issue #1265).
 *
 * 2. **Two replicas send one email.** The exclusion is a conditional
 *    `UPDATE ... RETURNING` -- the claim *is* the serialization point. Two
 *    mocked sweeps cannot race; two real ones against one database can.
