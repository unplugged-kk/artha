/**
 * The attachment lifecycle's external half, against a real database and a storage
 * provider whose put can be made to land whenever the test says (audit RRV4-002).
 *
 * The metadata fence added for RV4-002 is correct and is not what this is about: it
 * guarantees that a *metadata row* never commits over deleted bytes. The remaining
 * failure is about bytes. An object-store put that stalls past its 15-minute lease
 * can complete *after* the sweep deleted the key, and the uploader's compensating
 * delete runs only if that process is still alive:
 *
 *   1. intent committed, put started;
 *   2. the put stalls past the lease;
 *   3. the sweep claims the row, deletes a key where nothing is yet visible;
 *   4. the put lands, creating the object;
 *   5. the process is killed before `clearUploadIntent` and before the `catch`.
 *
 * With the row dropped at step 3 there is nothing left that names the key, so those
 * bytes are unreferenced *and* unenumerable -- a receipt or a bank statement, so a
 * retention problem rather than only a storage one. The row therefore has to outlive
 * the writer, which is what these specs check: what the table still holds after each
 * step, and whether a later pass removes the late object.
 *
 * A unit test cannot settle it. The claim, the conditional retirement and the
 * upsert's refusal are three SQL predicates over one row, and step 5 is defined by
 * what is *durable* -- so the fixture has to be a real database and a real
 * post-crash read.
