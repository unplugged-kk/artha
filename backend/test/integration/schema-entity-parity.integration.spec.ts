/**
 * The integration harness builds its schema from entity metadata
 * (`synchronize: true`); production applies `database/schema.sql`. Where an
 * entity omits an `onDelete` that schema.sql declares, the two databases behave
 * differently -- and the difference is invisible until a test asserts a cascade
 * that only production performs, or fails to reproduce one that only production
 * performs.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `user_currency_preferences.currency_code` is
 * `ON DELETE CASCADE` in schema.sql and was `NO ACTION` here, which is the FK
 * that made P2-009 a silent cross-tenant deletion: in the harness the same
 * DELETE could only ever have raised a foreign-key error, so the data loss was
 * not reproducible in an integration test at all.
 *
 * 55 further foreign keys drift the same way today. Correcting them all is an
 * entity-wide change with its own review, so they are baselined here and the
 * list may only SHRINK: a new drift fails this test, and a fixed one fails it
 * too, with a message saying to delete the line. That is the same shrink-only
 * shape `array-bound-dto.spec.ts` and `messages.punctuation.test.ts` use.
 *
 * Production is unaffected either way -- it never runs `synchronize`. What is
 * affected is whether an integration suite is evidence about production.
