/**
 * Migration 149's backfill, against the states the *previous* implementation
 * could actually leave behind (audit RV4-003).
 *
 * The point of the fixture is the ordering the old code used: it persisted
 * `claim_token_hash` **before** calling `sendMail`. So a hash means only that
 * issuance was attempted, and a backfill that read it as delivery would mark a
 * contact whose send failed as notified -- putting them outside the recovery query
 * forever. Two shapes are reachable and both were mishandled:
 *
 *   * partial delivery -- one send succeeded, one failed, both hashes present, and
 *     `granted_at` stayed set because at least one landed;
 *   * total failure -- every hash present, every send failed, and the old code
 *     reset `granted_at` to null.
 *
 * A unit test cannot check this: the assertion is about what a SQL predicate
 * concludes from production-shaped rows, so the fixture is a real database and the
 * migration is read from disk.
