/**
 * Vendor third-party browser assets into `public/` so they are served from our
 * own origin.
 *
 * Two things live here, for two different reasons:
 *
 * - OpenCV.js is not imported through the module graph (see the reasoning in
 *   `src/lib/document-scanner/opencv-engine.ts`), so the bundler never sees it
 *   and something has to put the file where the browser can fetch it.
 * - pdf.js IS bundled (`src/lib/attachment-preview/pdf-engine.ts` imports it
 *   behind a dynamic import), but it renders in a Web Worker it constructs
 *   itself from a URL, and the worker script must be the SAME version as the
 *   bundled API or pdf.js refuses to start. Copying it from the installed
 *   package at build time is what keeps the two in step; the engine pins the
 *   request to `pdfjs.version` with a query string so a stale HTTP-cached
 *   worker cannot answer for a newer API.
 *
 * Copied from `node_modules` at build time rather than committed, because they
 * are build artefacts of pinned dependencies (OpenCV alone is 13 MB). The
 * destination is gitignored.
