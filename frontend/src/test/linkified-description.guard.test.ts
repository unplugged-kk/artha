/**
 * Every render of a stored description or memo is classified, in both

 *
 * A transaction's description is where a ticket, receipt or order page ends up,
 * and `LinkifiedText` is what makes the address in it clickable. The mistake
 * this guards is the one the root `CLAUDE.md` names -- "the fix for one surface
 * is not the fix": the register was linkified and the three report tables that
 * show the same field were not, so the same description was a link on one
 * screen and inert text on another.
 *
 * So the rule is not "use the component"; it is "decide, per surface, and say
 * why". `LINKIFIED` names the surfaces that draw links; `PLAIN` names every
 * other place a description or memo reaches the screen as text, each with the
 * reason it stays inert. The scan below must find exactly `PLAIN` -- a new
 * render that is in neither list fails here rather than shipping as a silent
 * third answer.
