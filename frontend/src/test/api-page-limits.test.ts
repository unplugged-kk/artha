/**
 * No call site may ask a paged endpoint for more rows than it accepts.
 *
 * The server does not clamp an over-cap `limit`, it rejects the request, and
 * every one of these calls sits behind a `.catch()` that degrades to an empty
 * list. So the 400 never surfaces as an error -- it surfaces as a number that
 * is quietly, permanently zero. That is issue #1229 (the recurring-charges
 * panel found no subscriptions at all) and it is the same defect that made the
 * investment detail page report every year's dividends and interest as 0.00.
 * Both were one literal, in one file, and neither failed a test.
 *
 * Lowering the literal to the cap is not the fix either: that turns a visible
 * zero into a plausible undercount, which is worse. Walk the pages
 * (`transactionsApi.getAllPages`, `investmentsApi.getAllTransactionPages`) or
 * narrow the query until one page is enough.
 *
 * Modelled on `src/test/ui-conventions.test.ts` -- a scan of the whole tree,
 * because a test around the one component that was fixed cannot catch the next
 * instance, and there was always a next instance.
