/**
 * Guard for issue #1316: the configured number locale is the single source of
 * truth for every figure addressed to a user, the way `useDateFormat()` is for
 * dates.
 *
 * Monize has had a preference-aware formatter (`useNumberFormat()`) and a
 * preference-blind one (`@/lib/format`) side by side for a long time, and the
 * second is the one a component reaches for when the first needs a hook. So a
 * Polish user with `numberFormat: 'pl-PL'` read `zl18,812.71` on the Securities
 * page and `18 812,71 zl` on the page beside it.
 *
 * Four fingerprints reproduce every instance that was found:
 *
 *   1. a React/UI file importing the raw `formatCurrency` / `formatShareQuantity`;
 *   2. a numeric `toLocaleString()`, which follows the BROWSER -- and an explicit
 *      `numberFormat` exists precisely to override the browser, so swapping a
 *      hardcoded `en-US` for a bare `toLocaleString()` is not a fix;
 *   3. `toFixed(n)` concatenated with a literal `%`, which is a `.` decimal in
 *      every locale and puts the `%` where English puts it;
 *   4. a hardcoded `en-US` `Intl.NumberFormat` in runtime code.
 *
 * Each allowlist entry below is a classified fixed-locale contract, not a
 * grandfathered offender. Prefer shrinking it to widening a pattern.
