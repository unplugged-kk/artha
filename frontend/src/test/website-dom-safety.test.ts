/**
 * The marketing site's JavaScript builds every node with `document.createElement`
 * and text nodes -- it never assigns a built-up string to `innerHTML`.
 *
 * `website/assets/js/app.js` shipped with five `innerHTML` sinks that
 * interpolated the page's own content model into markup, and Bearer failed the
 * whole pipeline on them (CWE-79). The content is hardcoded, so nothing was
 * exploitable that day; the objection is that the shape is one edit away from
 * being exploitable, and the site has no build step, no framework escaping and
 * no CSP to fall back on. The fix was `el(tag, className, ...children)` plus
 * `fill()`/`clear()`, which cannot produce markup from data.
 *
 * The site is not covered by any other suite -- it is static files served
 * directly -- so this scan is the only thing standing between a future edit and
 * a red pipeline. It lives here because the frontend's Vitest is the nearest
 * JavaScript test runner, the same reason `dockerignore.test.ts` reaches out to
 * `backend/.dockerignore` from this directory.
