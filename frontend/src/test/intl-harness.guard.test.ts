/**
 * One test harness supplies intl and theme, and tests reach it through
 * `@/test/render`.
 *
 * The defect this replaces was structural rather than careless. `render.tsx`
 * has always loaded every English namespace from a glob, but it wrapped only
 * `render`; its `export * from '@testing-library/react'` re-exported
 * `renderHook` untouched. So a hook test had no way to get a provider except to
 * build one, and fourteen files did -- each with a hand-picked namespace list,
 * every one of them partial. `useImportWizard` reads `import` and `common`; its
 * test supplied `import` alone, so every `common` lookup returned its key while
 * the test passed.
 *
 * Two scans, because the harness has two ways to be bypassed:
 *
 *   1. Importing `render`/`renderHook` from `@testing-library/react` rather
 *      than from `@/test/render`, which is how a test ends up with no provider.
 *   2. Building a `NextIntlClientProvider` in a test, which is how it ends up
 *      with a partial one. Nested inside the shared render it is worse than it
 *      looks -- the inner provider SHADOWS the full message set for everything
 *      below it, so adding one narrows the catalogue rather than widening it.
 *
 * Both lists shrink only. An entry is a deliberate exception with a reason, not
 * a to-do: a test that genuinely varies the locale has to build its own
 * provider, because the shared one pins `en`.
 */
/**
 * TEST files only. Both patterns are correct and necessary in production --
 * `app/layout.tsx` and `app/global-error.tsx` mount the real
 * `NextIntlClientProvider`, which is the thing being mirrored here -- so a scan
 * over all of `src/` would report the application itself.
