/**
 * What a whole position in one security is worth right now: the shares held
 * across every account times the security's most recent close.
 *
 * The figure is in the **security's own currency** -- both inputs are quoted
 * there, so nothing is converted and no exchange rate can be missing. A caller
 * that shows it beside amounts in another currency has to name the currency
 * (`withCurrencyCode`), because a bare symbol does not.
 *
 * The two answers this deliberately keeps apart:
 *
 * - **Zero shares is zero.** A security in the catalog that nobody holds is
 *   worth nothing whatever its price does, and no price is needed to say so.
 *   That is a measurement, not a gap, so it is not `null`.
 * - **Shares with no usable price is unknown.** `null`, never `0` and never the
 *   share count passed through: a holding whose price never arrived is a value
 *   nobody knows, and rendering it as zero states that the position is
 *   worthless. "Usable" is `usableClose`'s rule -- a positive finite number;
 *   0, a negative and NaN are all "no price".
 *
 * Shares and price are read defensively because both cross the wire: a decimal
 * column arrives as a string from some endpoints, and an older backend sends no
 * price field at all.
