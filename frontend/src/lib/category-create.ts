/**
 * Turning text typed into a picker into a category happens on five surfaces:
 * the transaction form's category field and each of its split lines, the
 * scheduled transaction form and its splits, and the asset-value category on
 * the account form. The rules below -- title casing, and the `Parent: Child`
 * shorthand that creates or reuses a parent -- had been written out inline
 * three times, and the scheduled form's copy had neither, so `travel: hotels`
 * became a child of Travel in one field and a single flat category literally
 * named "Travel: Hotels" in another.
 *
 * `createCategoryFromInput` is the only place typed text becomes a category,
 * on either ledger it can land on -- `categoriesApi.create` for the caller's
 * own, `delegationApi.createJointCategory` for the owner of a joint account.
 * The guard in `src/test/ui-conventions.test.ts` fails on a second call site
 * for either, outside the categories page's own full create form.
 *
 * It lives beside `categories.ts` rather than inside it for two reasons: that
 * module is a typed axios wrapper (`frontend/CLAUDE.md`) and this is
 * multi-request orchestration over it, and roughly thirty suites replace
 * `@/lib/categories` wholesale with a mock -- a helper defined in the mocked
 * module would vanish with it, while one that *imports* it runs against
 * whatever `categoriesApi` the test installed.
