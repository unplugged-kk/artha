 * honour: Firefox has required a user gesture since 72 and shows nothing
 * without one, Chrome quiets the prompt for origins with a poor grant rate, and
 * iOS shows it only inside an installed web app. So the browser prompt here is
 * always behind a click on our own copy, which explains what the notifications
