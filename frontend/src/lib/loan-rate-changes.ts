 * The account types the rate-changes endpoints accept. Every route under
 * `/accounts/:id/rate-changes` goes through `LoanRateChangesService
 * .verifyLoanAccount`, which answers **400** for anything else -- so this is not
 * a display preference, it is the request's precondition, and asking for a line
 * of credit's rate history is an error rather than an empty list.
 *
 * It lives here, beside the client, because the callers are surfaces that list
 * *debt* accounts (LOAN, MORTGAGE and LINE_OF_CREDIT) and so cannot assume the
 * selected one qualifies. Both loan reports fetched unconditionally and a
 * selected line of credit turned the whole report into its error state --
 * persisted in localStorage, so it stayed broken across reloads with no in-page
 * way to choose another account.
 *
 * Exported because two other lists answer the same question for their own
 * reasons and must not be spelled a second time: the projection hook's
 * "amortizing debt" set (a revolving line does not amortize, which is the same
 * fact that gives it no contractual rate to change) derives from this one, and
 * `loan-rate-changes.contract.test.ts` checks the derivation, the backend's
 * copy of the list, and the account page's detail-view registry against it.
