 * Starting instruments per GEM role, for a portfolio that has never held one.
 *
 * Each entry is a widely held, long-lived ETF tracking the index its role is
 * defined by, with enough history for the momentum window. They are a starting
 * point, not advice: every role can be pointed at a different instrument.
 *
 * Suggestions come in regional listings because the same index is bought
 * through a different fund depending on where the account is. A US brokerage
 * buys the US-listed ETF; a European one generally cannot, and buys the UCITS
 * equivalent instead. Monize has no regional setting to choose between them, so
 * the picker offers both and the investor picks the listing their broker
 * actually trades -- the exchange and currency are theirs to confirm when the
 * instrument is created.
 *
 * The two defensive roles are deliberately different funds, which is how the
 * original rules read: T-bills are the yardstick the absolute test measures
 * against, while a RISK-OFF period is spent in an aggregate bond fund.

 * the same time -- there is one CSPX or none.
 *
 * Keying on `symbol|exchange|currency` was therefore a stricter identity than
 * the data model can hold, and the picker paid for the difference: an owned
 * EXUS entered with no exchange, or with the user's own, did not match the
 * suggestion, so the suggestion offered to *create* it and the server answered
 * "Security with symbol EXUS already exists". The one-click fill hit the same
 * wall and stopped at the first role. A UI notion of "you already have this"
 * that is narrower than the server's uniqueness rule can only produce actions
 * the server is guaranteed to refuse.
 *
 * The region a suggestion belongs to still decides what gets *created* when
 * nothing with that symbol exists, and the exchange and currency are still
 * confirmed in the create form. They just do not decide whether it exists.
