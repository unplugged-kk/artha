 * money between the user's own accounts and is neither a bill nor a deposit,
 * and an amount of exactly zero is a deliberate placeholder -- a reminder for
 * something whose amount is not known until it arrives (a credit card bill, a
 * variable utility). Both are real schedules with real due dates, so both
 * belong on a calendar; classifying with a bare `amount < 0` / `amount > 0`
 * pair silently drops them.

 * is no information: it falls back to the occurrence's amount, then to the
 * schedule's sign, which is what this function did for every case before the
 * server could tell the two apart. The magnitude never comes from the schedule --
 * use the occurrence's `amount`, and `UnknownAmount` when it is null.
