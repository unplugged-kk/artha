/**
 * Build one forecast line per selected account, plus the "Total of Accounts"
 * line that is their sum.
 *
 * Each line uses the same rules as the single-account forecast
 * (`scheduledFlowsForAccount`): the account's own schedules, plus transfers
 * where it is the destination. So a transfer between two selected accounts
 * moves both lines and nets to zero in the total -- which is what a total of
 * those accounts means -- while a transfer out to an account that is not
 * selected leaves the total, as it should.
 *
 * Every line shares one y-axis, so every line is in one currency: each
 * account's balances and amounts are converted into the display currency
 * through `convertAmount`. As in `buildForecast`, a projected balance is
 * cumulative, so one missing rate withholds the whole result rather than
 * drawing a plausible line.
 *
 * `accountIds` order is preserved: it is the order the legend reads and the
 * order colours are assigned in, and the caller -- not this function -- knows
 * how its account picker sorts.
