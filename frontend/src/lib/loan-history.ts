/**
 * Historical loan-payment derivation shared by the loan reports and the loan
 * detail page.
 *
 * Payments to the loan appear as positive transactions on the loan account.
 * The interest portion of a regular installment is recovered, in order of
 * preference:
 *   1. an overpayment recognized by the loan's overpayment category or its
 *      overpayment memo text is 100% principal, so its interest is 0 and the
 *      row is flagged OVERPAYMENT;
 *   2. otherwise, if the linked source-account transaction carries an interest
 *      split (the shape ScheduledTransactionLoanService builds), that recorded
 *      interest is used -- exact even on variable-rate loans;
 *   3. otherwise the payment recorded no interest, so it is 100% principal and
 *      its interest is a known **zero** -- never an estimate derived from the
 *      balance and the account's rate. Historical rows report the ledger: a
 *      figure the borrower never paid inflates "Interest Paid", every cumulative
 *      total built on it, the CSV/PDF exports, and the installment the forward
 *      projection is seeded with (issue #1255).
 *
 * The balance walk is unchanged -- it always tracks the actual ledger amount,
 * so the projected balance still ends at the account's current balance.
 *
 * Zero here is a *measured* zero, which is why it is a number and not null: the
 * ledger was read and it recorded no interest. A ledger that could not be read
 * is a different state, and `fetchLoanInterestTransactions` rejects rather than
 * returning an empty list so its callers can tell the two apart.

 * at a stale 5% against a real 12%, a payment $100 short of the interest looks
 * comfortably amortizing.
 *

 *
 *   1. a payment stated by an applicable `manual` or `inferred` rate-change row
 *      -- the recorded answer to "what is being paid now", so one that no longer

 *      complete installment was actually paid AFTER the row stating it: that
 *      later payment is the newer statement (see `observedIsNewer` below);
 *   2. otherwise a COMPLETE observed installment -- `principal + interest` of the
 *      last regular payment, where that interest is known -- also unconditionally,
 *      for the same reason: it is a complete statement of what is being paid;
 *   3. otherwise the `initial` row's snapshot payment, then the stored
 *      contractual `paymentAmount`, first one that covers a period's interest.
 *
 * An INCOMPLETE observation is not a candidate at any rank. `principal + 0` for
 * a loan booking interest outside the app is a PART of the installment, not a
 * smaller one, and it clears the amortization guard easily -- a principal-only
 * figure usually does exceed one period's interest (issue #1255's own example:
 * 285 of principal against 91.67 of interest, against a contractual 1,200). So
 * ranking it ahead of the contractual figure made that documented fallback fire
 * only when the principal-only number happened to be the smaller one.
 *
 * An `initial` row's payment is not rank 1: it is a real observed installment
 * when detection wrote it and a verbatim copy of `account.paymentAmount` when
 * the first-rate-change hook did, and nothing on the row distinguishes them.
 * Seeding it unconditionally pinned the projection to a snapshot of the very
 * field the user would edit to fix it; discarding it threw away a real
 * observation. It joins rank 3 instead, ahead of the scalar and tested like it.
 *
 * The contractual figure is last because it is often stale, but it is a real
 * stored fact and it is the only complete payment a loan booking its interest
 * outside the app has left. When nothing complete resolves the payment is null:
 * the payoff and remaining interest read as unknown rather than as a figure
 * built on a fraction of the real installment, which is what the estimate in

 *
 * Only when no rate history is recorded does the reconstruction below run: the
 * interest charged, annualized over the actual days since interest was last
 * settled (`interest / balanceBefore x 365 / days`). The period runs from the previous *interest-bearing* event, not
 * merely the previous row: a pure-principal overpayment (no interest) does not
 * reset the accrual clock, so the following installment still covers the whole
 * month -- measuring from the overpayment instead would divide a full month's
 * interest by a few days and report an absurd rate. Using the real gap keeps
 * the rate correct across partial first periods, payment holidays, and
 * mid-cycle overpayments that do carry interest. The first interest-bearing row
 * falls back to the nominal period length. Events must be sorted by date;
 * `balanceBefore` is the post-payment balance plus the principal paid, i.e. the
 * debt the interest accrued on.
 *
 * When a period's interest was booked irregularly -- most of it charged
 * alongside an overpayment, or a payment holiday leaving only a partial stub on
 * the regular installment -- the true accrual span is unrecoverable and the
 * annualized observed rate is misleadingly low. Such a row (booked interest
 * below `FULL_PERIOD_INTEREST_RATIO` of a full period's expected accrual at the
 * contractual rate) shows the timeline rate in effect on its date instead. A
 * full-period installment keeps its observed rate, which tracks the real
 * variable rate month to month. Falls back to the plain observed rate when no
 * timeline rate is available to compare against.
 *
 * A regular row that charged no interest has nothing to reconstruct from, and
 * for a **fixed**-rate loan that is not the same as an unknown rate: the
 * configured `interestRate` was in effect on that date regardless of what the
 * payment settled, so the row keeps showing it. A variable-rate loan with no
 * recorded history genuinely does not know its rate on that date, and stays
 * null. Historical *interest* is the ledger's to state (issue #1255); the
 * historical *rate* is the loan's, and one must not be dropped with the other.

 * interest category or source account set.
 *
 * **Rejects on a failed lookup rather than returning [].** An empty list is a
 * claim about the ledger -- `deriveLoanPaymentHistory` reads it as "no interest
 * was booked against these payments, so their interest is zero" -- and a
 * timeout, a 500 or a proxy error is not that claim. Swallowing the failure
 * here rendered a plausible, wrong Interest Paid of 0.00 with no way for the
 * user to tell it from a real one. Every caller routes the rejection into its
 * own error-and-retry state.
 *
 * Only genuinely standalone interest expenses are returned. The category filter
 * also matches interest booked as a *split leg* of a payment (the backend
 * matches `splits.categoryId`), but that interest is already attributed to its
 * payment through the recorded interest split (path 2 of
 * `deriveLoanPaymentHistory`); returning it here as well would double-count it.
 * A standalone expense carries the interest category at the top level (split
 * parents have a null top-level category) and is not a transfer, so filtering
 * on that keeps only the interest this separate-expense path is meant to handle.
 *
 * Scoping to this loan is by the configured interest category + source account:
 * `deriveLoanPaymentHistory` no longer date-bounds the result, so all of it
 * counts (an interest-only grace period or migrated history included). Pointing
 * two loans at one interest category would therefore merge them -- give each
 * loan its own interest category to keep them apart.
 *
 * **A failed lookup REJECTS; it is not an empty result.** `[]` means one of two
 * things and only those two: the loan is not configured for separate-interest
 * booking, or the query ran and this loan genuinely has no standalone interest
 * expenses. A `catch { return [] }` here made a transient 500 or timeout
 * indistinguishable from the second -- and every one of this function's callers
 * already has the error state it should have reached. `useLoanProjection`
 * reports the projection as unknown, the account detail page has an outer error
 * boundary, and both the Debt Payoff Timeline and the Overpayment Simulator run
 * on `useReportData`'s error-and-retry. The helper was swallowing the failure
 * before any of them could see it, so the history was recomputed from a
 * fabricated empty interest list.
 *
 * What that produced changed with this work, and both readings are worth
 * keeping. Against the analytic estimate this module used to carry, every row
 * of a loan that books interest separately fell back to an INVENTED figure, so
 * the outage rendered a full history of plausible interest. With the estimate
 * deleted (issue #1255) the same outage renders a measured **zero** instead --
 * quieter, and no less wrong, because "the ledger recorded no interest" is a
 * claim this function is not entitled to make on a failed read. The rule in
 * `frontend/CLAUDE.md` covers both: a failed lookup is not an empty dataset,
 * and rendering the failure as emptiness turns an outage into an answer.
