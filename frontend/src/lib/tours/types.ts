 *   security detail page has nothing to open without one, and every step after
 *   the first would be a dead end.
 * - `accountsExist` the user has at least one open account that can open a
 *   dedicated detail page (`hasAccountDetailView`). Deliberately its own
 *   requirement rather than a second reading of `transactionEntry`: the two ask
 *   different questions of the same list -- "is there something to record
 *   against" and "is there a Details page to open" -- so tightening either one
