/**
 * The full foreign-currency workflow (#931, #933, #935, #949): configure a
 * card's foreign-transaction fee, record a purchase in a foreign currency, see
 * the resulting per-account fee section, and find the cross-account report.
 *
 * It is deliberately interactive because there is no way to synthesize the
 * dynamic pieces (a specific account id, an open form, real foreign activity):
 *  - The fee step opens the account edit form itself (`appear` on the fee
 *    field, which the form always renders) and closes it again (`disappear`).
 *  - The transaction step opens the New Transaction form the same way and
 *    points at the entry-currency picker, whose popover hosts "Add currency..."
 *    for users whose only active currency is their own.
 *  - The detail-page steps use interactive route advances to `/accounts/` --
 *    the user opens the account via its Details action. When the account has no
 *    foreign activity yet, the fee-section anchor never mounts and the engine
 *    gracefully skips that step (falling through to the centered finish/outro),
 *    so the tour never strands silently.
 *
 * Every anchor it relies on is either page-level (New Transaction, the report
 * card) or a form field that renders unconditionally (the fee input, the
 * currency picker), so the tour runs on every viewport without desktop-only
 * skips.
