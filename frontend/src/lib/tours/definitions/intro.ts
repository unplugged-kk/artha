/**
 * Evergreen "New User Introduction" tour. Walks a first-time user from the
 * dashboard through the core areas: customizing the dashboard, the Tools menu,
 * Accounts (including an interactive detour that opens an account's own
 * type-specific detail page), and the transaction register, with a second
 * interactive detour that opens the New Transaction form to explain
 * payees/categories/amounts, splits, and foreign currencies before asking the
 * user to close the form again. It then
 * visits Bills & Deposits, Investments, Budgets, and Reports. Offered from the
 * Getting Started card and from Settings.
 *
 * Steps anchored on desktop-only header controls (the Tools dropdown) or the
 * desktop Split button are `skipOnMobile`; the page steps use centered cards so
 * they show on every viewport.
 *
 * The steps that introduce a whole screen -- Dashboard, Tools, Accounts,
 * Transactions, Bills, Investments, Budgets, Reports -- are `unobtrusive`:
 * dimming would hide the very page being described. Anchored ones keep their
 * highlight ring, so they still point at the control they name.
 *
 * The steps that render inside the open transaction form are `skipOnBack`: once
 * the user has closed it, Back has to walk past them, or it would land on a
 * step whose anchor can never mount again and strand the tour.
 *
 * The record-a-transaction detour `requires` an account to record against: for
 * a user who has none yet, walking through the form teaches nothing, so the
 * engine omits those five steps entirely. The account-detail pair `requires` an
 * account with a dedicated detail page for the same reason -- there is nothing
 * for a zero-account user to open, and the tour continues without them.
