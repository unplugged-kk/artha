/**
 * Every cache family is classified as transaction-derived or not.
 *
 * `balance-cache.guard.test.ts` polices one half of the rule: a write that moves
 * money must call `invalidateBalanceCaches()`. This is the other half, and it is
 * the half that failed. `budgets:` was added to the cache without being added to
 * the invalidator, so every money-moving write correctly called a function that
 * did not drop the budget progress bar sitting next to it -- the number a user
 * makes the next spending decision from. Both guards were green.
 *
 * A prefix is transaction-derived when its cached value is computed from
 * transaction rows: an account balance, a portfolio valuation, a budget's
 * progress. It is reference data when a transaction write cannot change it: the
 * payee list, the category tree, a report *definition* (as opposed to a report
 * result), an institution, a tag.
 *
 * A new prefix in neither list fails this test, which is the point: the decision
 * is cheap to make while writing the cache call and invisible afterwards.
