/**
 * Guards the English catalogs against a double hyphen reaching the screen.
 *
 * `--` is this repo's *code comment* style, and the convention is strong enough
 * that agents carry it straight into UI copy, where it renders literally and
 * reads as a typo. A human has had to point this out more than once, which is
 * exactly the signal that the rule needs enforcing rather than restating: see
 * "Follow the existing pattern, and pin it down when you miss it" in the root
 * CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * In copy, use an em dash, or recast the sentence. Both read correctly in every
 * locale; `--` reads correctly in none.
 *
 * Only `en` is scanned. It is the locale we author -- the others are filled in
 * one pass at acceptance -- so a failure here always names a string someone in
 * this repo just wrote, and is always actionable. A translator's punctuation is
 * their own business.
 *
 * This is a ratchet, in the shape of `backend/scripts/rls-ratchet.mjs`: the
 * baseline below may only shrink. Both directions are enforced, so cleaning a
 * string means deleting its line here, and adding one fails the build.

 * Read from disk rather than through `import.meta.glob`, matching the sibling

 * though Vitest runs it.
