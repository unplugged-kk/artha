/**
 * Keeps the import wizard's advertised file formats in step with the ones it
 * actually accepts, in every locale.
 *
 * `.mny` was added to the upload input's `accept` list when the Microsoft Money
 * importer landed, and the copy naming the formats was not: the page subtitle
 * and the "Supported formats" sentence went on listing QIF, OFX/QFX and CSV in
 * all 23 locales, and the drop-zone line was updated in `en` alone. The feature
 * worked and nothing on the page said so, which is the same defect as not
 * shipping it.
 *
 * The accept list is the source of truth because it is what the file picker
 * enforces. Adding an extension there and nowhere else now fails here rather
 * than shipping an undiscoverable format -- and it fails per locale, because a
 * translated catalog is exactly where the second half of the edit gets
 * forgotten.
