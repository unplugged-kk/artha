/**
 * The ZAP baseline scan reports every entry it finds in localStorage on a
 * public page (rule 120000, INFO risk), and `.github/zap/rules.tsv` silences
 * that rule on a single claim: everything the app writes before login is a
 * zustand persist envelope carrying no user data, no credential and no PII.
 *
 * That claim is about the source, so it is checked here rather than left in a
 * comment. The IGNORE line would otherwise outlive the footprint it was
 * written for -- a new persisted store, or a widened `partialize`, silently
 * ships under a rule that was silenced for something else.
