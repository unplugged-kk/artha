/**
 * What the instrument is made of, one dimension at a time.
 *
 * The three breakdowns share a card and a tab rather than stacking: they answer
 * the same shape of question, only one is worth reading at a time, and side by
 * side (or stacked) they would make the column beside the price chart several
 * times its height.
 *
 * The card fills the height its column gives it and its panel area scrolls, so
 * the card ends level with the chart beside it and switching tabs cannot change
 * where it ends. A card that resized itself as the reader moved between sector,
 * country and asset class made the whole row jump.
 *
 * Sector comes from the quote provider; country and asset class are the user's
 * own, entered when editing the security. Each is `{ name, weight }` with weight
 * a decimal 0-1, so one set of bars renders all three.
