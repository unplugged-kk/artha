/**
 * A breakdown of one security across a dimension -- sectors, countries, and
 * (once the field exists) asset classes.
 *
 * Horizontal bars, sorted largest first, in a single hue. This is one series
 * answering "how big is each share", not eleven categories needing eleven
 * colours: a pie of eleven sectors needs a legend to be read at all, and
 * colour-coding rows whose names are already printed beside them adds nothing
 * but a colourblindness problem. Each share is labelled directly, so the bar is
 * a second reading of the number rather than the only one.
 *
 * Bars are drawn against 100%, so a 32% share fills a third of its track and the
 * empty remainder is part of the reading. They were briefly scaled against the
 * largest share instead, which drew the biggest sector full width whatever its
 * size -- a bar claiming everything beside a label saying 32% contradicts the
 * number it is supposed to restate, and that is worse than the sliver bars the
 * relative scaling was avoiding.
 *
 * Renders its empty state, not empty bars, when the data is absent. A security
 * with no sector data is not a security with zero-length bars.
 *
 * A long breakdown scrolls inside a capped height rather than growing the card
 * or hiding rows behind a button. The card sits beside the price chart, so its
 * height must not depend on whether a fund reports three sectors or eleven, nor
 * on which tab is open. An expander left a gap under the chart, and cutting the
 * list needed a click to answer a question the bars exist to answer at a glance.
 * The scrollbar is `scrollbar-slim`: the native one is a wide arrowed control
 * drawn against the figures, which is what made this look broken the first time
 * round.
