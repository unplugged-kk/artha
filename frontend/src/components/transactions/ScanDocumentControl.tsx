/**
 * The "Scan document" button and the hidden input behind it.
 *
 * Deliberately a sibling of the plain upload rather than a replacement for it:
 * a photo picked through Upload is stored exactly as it was taken, and only a
 * file chosen here goes through the scanner. Nothing detects a document on the
 * ordinary path, so an ordinary attachment is never modified by surprise.
 *
 * On a touch device the input carries `capture="environment"`, which hands off
 * to the OS camera and opens the rear lens. That attribute is not governed by
 * the `Permissions-Policy: camera=()` header this app sends -- that policy
 * covers `getUserMedia`, an in-page viewfinder, which the scanner deliberately
 * does not use.
 *
 * The predicate is the POINTER, not the viewport (`isTouchDevice`, and
 * `frontend/CLAUDE.md`'s rule). `capture` does not merely restyle anything: on
 * a browser that honours it the OS file picker is replaced by the camera, so
 * keying it off a 639px width would take the "choose an existing photo" path
 * away from anyone with a narrow desktop window, and give it back when they
 * widened it.
