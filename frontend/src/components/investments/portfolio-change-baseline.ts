 * from the first plotted point silently drops whatever the portfolio did
 * between the previous close and that point. Every other quote source reports
 * these three against the prior close, so this does too.
 *

 * point: there the window boundary is an arbitrary calendar date rather than a
 * session boundary, and the first point already *is* the close of the day the
