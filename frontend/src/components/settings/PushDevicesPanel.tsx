/**
 * The bordered block every branch of this panel renders into.
 *
 * `collapsedSummary` makes it foldable, and only the configured branch passes
 * one: the other three are a single sentence saying why push is unavailable,
 * and a disclosure that hides the reason behind a click is worse than no
 * disclosure. The `<details>`/`<summary>` pair is the same shape
 * `PushDiagnostics` uses twenty lines below -- native keyboard operation, and
 * the expanded/collapsed state announced without an `aria-expanded` of our own.
 *
 * `open` is a controlled prop rather than a one-shot attribute, and the summary
 * click is handled here rather than left to the element. React does not manage
 * `open` for us, so setting it once and letting the element toggle itself
 * leaves the state this component renders from disagreeing with the DOM the
 * moment the user folds the block -- and the count is rendered off exactly that
 * state. `onToggle` alone is not enough to close that gap either: it is the
 * only signal a native toggle gives, and jsdom flips `open` without ever firing
 * it, so the behaviour would be untestable here and a missed event in any
 * browser would leave the count describing the wrong state. It stays wired
 * anyway for the toggles no click produces -- Chrome expands a `<details>` to
 * show a find-in-page match.
 *
 * The fold is remembered per browser (`settingsSectionStore`), not per account:
 * whether this panel is worth its height is a fact about the screen in front of
 * the reader, the same reasoning row density and the register's date view are
 * stored on. It defaults to open, so a reader who has never folded it sees
 * exactly what they saw before -- and a stored value that is not a boolean
 * falls back to that default rather than hiding push behind a corrupted entry.
