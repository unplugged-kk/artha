/**
 * The pager below a table: where you are in the list, repeated at the end of
 * it.
 *
 * `ListTopToolbar` is the strip above the rows and this is its counterpart, so
 * a reader who has just scrolled a full page of rows meets the controls where
 * they finished rather than having to scroll back. The two are separate
 * components because the top strip also carries the controls that act on the
 * whole list (density, export) and the bottom deliberately does not: repeating
 * a toggle is not repeating a position.
 *
 * On a single page it draws the count instead of an inert pager. That differs
 * from the top strip, which keeps its pager for a reason its own comment gives
 * -- "Showing 1-7 of 7" is the answer to "did that filter work?", and it is
 * answered once, up there, where the filter controls are.
 *
 * It is drawn by the surface, not by the list, because it belongs *outside* the
 * card the rows sit in -- `Pagination` carries its own background and shadow, so
 * inside a rounded panel it reads as a white box on a white panel. The top strip
 * is the opposite: it is the panel's own header row, which is why that one lives
 * in the list. Anything drawing a pager below a table composes this rather than
 * repeating the markup (`ui-conventions.test.ts`).
