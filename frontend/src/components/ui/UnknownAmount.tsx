   * not resolve the current settlement exchange rate.
   *
   * `displayFx` is the other half of the same story and a different fix: the
   * component's own amount is known, in a currency with no rate into the one this
   * figure is reported in. Telling the reader to check the security's currency
   * when what is missing is a display rate sends them to the wrong screen.
   *
   * `noPrice` is a third cause with a third fix and no exchange rate in it at
   * all: the quantity is known, and the security has no quoted price to value it
   * at. Naming a currency pair here would send the reader to the Currencies page
   * over a rate that is already there.

/**
 * A single money figure the server could not work out, drawn as such.

 * The two wrong answers are a stale number and a zero: a scheduled investment
 * whose settlement currency pair no longer resolves has an amount nobody knows,
 * and printing either the persisted snapshot or `0.00` reads as a measurement
 * (issue #1247). `PartialTotal` is the sibling for an aggregate that is missing
 * components; this is for the one value that is missing entirely.
 *
 * The marker is a visible glyph plus a tooltip that says why, never colour
 * alone, and the reason is available to assistive technology.
