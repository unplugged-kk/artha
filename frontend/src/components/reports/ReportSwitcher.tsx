 * The caret beside a report's title that jumps straight to another report,
 * without going back to the list and picking again -- the same control the
 * account, payee, category and security detail pages carry.
 *
 * Fifty-odd reports are too many to read as one column, so the menu is grouped
 * by the section the Reports page files each under, in the same order its
 * filter chips use. The reports the user has starred are lifted into a
 * "Favourites" section above those, so the ones they open most are the first
 * thing the caret shows -- and because favourite status is read live (built-ins
 * from the reactive preference, saved reports from their own flag), toggling a
 * star reorders the menu without a reload. A favourite is shown once, at the
 * top; its category section keeps only the remaining reports.
 *
 * Picking a report navigates, and the route is built here rather than by each
 * caller: an id in this menu *is* a path under `/reports/`, and two call sites
 * spelling that out separately is one of them getting it wrong later.
