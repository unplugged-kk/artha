# Verify database/schema.sql is in sync with database/migrations/.
#
# Invariant (per database/CLAUDE.md): "Always update database/schema.sql
# alongside any migration." We check this by:
#
#   db_schema      = fresh DB + apply schema.sql
#   db_migrations  = fresh DB + apply schema.sql + apply all migrations
#
# If schema.sql is fully up to date, every migration uses IF NOT EXISTS /
# IF EXISTS guards and is a no-op on top of schema.sql, so the two dumps
# are identical. If someone adds a column in a migration but forgets to
# add it to schema.sql, db_migrations has the column and db_schema does
# not, and the diff fails the build.
#
# Note: migrations cannot recreate the full schema from scratch -- only
# the most recent ones live in database/migrations/, the older ones were
# rolled into schema.sql long ago.
#
# Usage: scripts/verify-schema.sh
#
# Requires: docker, diff. Uses an ephemeral postgres:16-alpine container.

# Applied TWICE (task B1): pass 1 proves each body is a no-op on an up-to-date
# schema, pass 2 proves it is a no-op on the state it just produced -- the case
# that bites in production, when a migration half-applies (crash between the DDL
# and the schema_migrations INSERT, restore from a mid-deploy snapshot) and the
# next boot re-runs the whole body. The static counterpart is

# leading digits as a number and breaks ties on the whole line, which is the
# same rule. `migration-filename.spec.ts` runs this exact pipeline against the
