// The decision behind the blocking half of the NPM Audit job: given what
// `npm audit --json` said, did we learn that the production dependencies are
// clean, that they carry an advisory, or nothing at all?
//
// `npm audit` exits 1 for a real advisory AND for an advisories endpoint it
// could not reach, so the exit code alone cannot separate "you shipped a
// vulnerability" from "npmjs is down". Both were indistinguishable red X's on
// PR #1308, twice, while `npm ci` in the same job resolved every package --
// only registry.npmjs.org's advisories endpoint was failing, first with a
// timeout and then with a 503.
//
// The discriminator is POSITIVE proof that an audit ran: a report carries
// `metadata.vulnerabilities`, and an endpoint failure carries a top-level
// `error` with no `metadata` at all. Keying on the report's presence rather
// than on the error's is what makes an unrecognised failure shape safe: it
// reads as "no answer", which is retried and then fails, instead of being
// mistaken for a clean audit.
//
// Only a no-answer is retried. An advisory fails on the first attempt, because
// a retry that could swallow a real finding is worse than no retry at all.
// And a no-answer that outlasts the retries still FAILS the build: "we could
// not verify" is not "verified clean". What changes is that it now says so.
//
