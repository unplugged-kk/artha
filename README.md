# Artha
> [!CAUTION] 
> This project is 100% written by AI. I've done practically zero manual changes. I am not a programmer by trade, but have dabbled in various languages over the years. This gives me high-level awareness on coding practices, but **I AM NOT SKILLED IN THE LANGUAGES USED IN THIS PRODUCT**. I have spent months prompting Claude Code for features, updates, fixes and tweaks. I have taken steps to ensure this is secure as it can be, given the constraints. I've performed numerous security audits (both AI-prompted and 3rd party) and have implemented best-practice security measures as much as I can (including 2FA and OIDC support). Every build must pass NPM audits and security scans before publishing. However, I can't personally guarantee the security of this code. **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**. 

A comprehensive personal finance management application built with NestJS and Next.js. Designed as a replacement for Microsoft Money and Intuit Quicken. 100% built using farm-fresh, free-range Claude Code.

## Why This Exists?
The personal finance ecosystem is flooded with personal finance platforms. I've tried many of them, but every single one of them had deal-breakers I couldn't work with. I finally decided to try my hand at creating my own platform that met all my criteria by using  "vibe-coding", which is a dirty word in the self-hosting community. I just wanted to see what was possible with the current state of AI. It turned out to be more successful than I ever could have imagined, which is why I'm making this available for others.

### A bit of background on my specific situation that brought me to create this project:
I've been a rabid user of [Microsoft Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Money) since 1995, when I had my first real job outside of university doing tech support for Microsoft. I started using it to keep track of my finances and to help get myself out of credit card debt. It allowed me to keep track of every aspect of my finances: chequing accounts, credit cards, loans, mortgages, investments, and more. Being software of the 90's, it didn't have much in the way of automation, especially for non-US customers. This forced me to meticulously enter every single transaction manually into Microsoft Money.

This "feature" helped me truly understand the state of my finances. I knew where every single penny went. Nothing was ever a surprise. I could forecast my finances out a year or more with precision. I've kept that going for more than THIRTY YEARS. Yes, even though Microsoft Money hasn't had a new version since 2010, I still use it. Everything from 1995 to today is stored in Microsoft Money. I can tell you my detailed financial picture going back to 1995. It certainly isn't perfect. I can only run it on one machine. There's no mobile app or anything of the sort. When I go on a trip or something, it can take hours after I return to enter and categorize my data. I've been increasingly wanting a true replacement for Microsoft Money. 

My perfect product to replace MS Money needed the following features:
- Must support all types of banking and investment types, including:
  - Chequing
  - Savings
  - Credit Cards
  - Loans
  - Mortgages
  - Line of Credit
  - Brokerage accounts
  - Asset accounts
- Must support importing from QIF (the export format used by MS Money and Quicken)
- Must be self-hostable via containerization
- Must support multiple currencies
- Must support pulling currency exchange rates and stock prices on a regular basis
- Must support PostgreSQL for the backend tables
- Must have a usable mobile app or web interface

Since I couldn't find anything out there to meet that criteria, I decided to create Artha! After weeks of vibe-coding and testing, I finally was able to migrate ALL of 30+ years of Microsoft Money data into Artha with no errors or discrepancies. Microsoft Money has finally been retired!

Artha is running in my [Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/kenlasko/k8s).


## Features
### Account Management
- Ten account types: Chequing, Savings, Credit Card, Loan, Mortgage, Line of Credit, Investment, Cash, Asset and Other
- Investment accounts with brokerage and investment-cash sub-types
- Support for multiple currencies per account

- Multi-currency transactions with automatic exchange rate tracking
- Import from CSV, OFX/QFX, and QIF (Quicken and Microsoft Money) with smart column auto-matching
- Microsoft Money full-file import: read a `.mny` file directly -- accounts, transfers, splits, investments, price history, exchange rates and scheduled bills -- and reconcile every balance against the file afterwards ([guide](docs/import-ms-money.md))
- Quicken full-file import: import all accounts, categories, and tags from a single QIF export
- Data reset: wipe financial data and re-import without losing your user account or settings
- Share into the app on Android: with Artha installed as a PWA, share a receipt photo, a PDF or a statement export (CSV, OFX, QFX, QIF) to it from another app and land on a review screen that offers to attach it to a new transaction or open the import wizard. Nothing is imported or attached until you choose it, and shared files are kept on the device for an hour

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 24 (for local development -- matches the container images)
- PostgreSQL 16+ (if running without Docker)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:unplugged-kk/artha.git
cd artha
```

2. Copy environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` and configure:
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - secure database password
   - `JWT_SECRET` - generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `PUBLIC_APP_URL` - your public frontend URL
   - OIDC settings (optional) for SSO authentication

4. Start the application:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

   The `-f` is required: every stack in this repository is an explicit target
   (see the tree above) and there is no default Compose file to fall back on.

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

### Development Setup (Without Docker)

1. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Set up PostgreSQL database:
```bash
createdb artha
psql artha < ../database/schema.sql
```

3. Create `backend/.env`:
```env
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=artha
DATABASE_USER=your_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

4. Start the backend:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

5. In a new terminal, set up frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp ../.env.example .env.local  # Update INTERNAL_API_URL if needed
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name | `artha` |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Database user | `artha_user` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password | `secure-password` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing key (min 32 chars) | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public frontend URL | `https://money.example.com` |

### Optional Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `INTERNAL_API_URL` | Backend URL for server-side calls | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Additional CORS origin | - |
| `LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED` | Enable local auth | `true` |
| `REGISTRATION_ENABLED` | Allow new user registration | `true` |
| `FORCE_2FA` | Require 2FA for all local users | `false` |

| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | **Set this.** Encrypts AI provider keys, emergency-access credentials and the password your backups are encrypted with (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Without it, backups are written unencrypted and no secret can be stored; the server warns on every boot and will require it in a future release. Keep it safe and keep it unchanged -- losing it makes every stored secret unreadable. Formerly `AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, which is still accepted | - |
| `AI_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` | System-level default AI provider (the centrally managed AI) | - |
| `AI_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Default model for the provider | - |

| `JWT_EXPIRATION` | JWT token expiration time | `15m` |
| `REMEMBER_ME_DAYS` | Duration for "Remember Me" sessions (days) | `30` |
| `DISABLE_HTTPS_HEADERS` | Disable HSTS and COOP headers for plain HTTP | `false` |
| `DEMO_MODE` | Enable demo mode with sample data | `false` |

The `AI_DEFAULT_*` and `AI_QUERY_*` variables configure the **centrally managed
AI** -- the provider used for any user who has not configured one of their own.
A user who adds their own provider in Settings -> AI owns its settings
completely, per-provider query limits included, and the environment does not
reach them.


## Deployment

### Docker Compose (Production)

1. Create `.env` from the example and set production values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set NODE_ENV=production, strong passwords, your domain, etc.
```

2. Build and start:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Kubernetes

The application is Kubernetes-ready with:
- Health endpoints: `/api/v1/health/live` and `/api/v1/health/ready`
- Standalone Next.js build for minimal image size
- Environment-based configuration

Example environment for K8s:
```yaml
# Frontend pod
- name: INTERNAL_API_URL
  value: "http://backend-svc:3000"
- name: PUBLIC_APP_URL
  value: "https://money.example.com"

# Backend pod
- name: PUBLIC_APP_URL
  value: "https://money.example.com"
```
